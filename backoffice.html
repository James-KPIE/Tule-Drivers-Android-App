                <p style="text-align: justify;">The Grade Point, G.P., as it is commonly
      called, has become the cruel taskmaster on every campus. Most students
      groan under its grips. No matter how hard they try, they seem not to
      discover what to do to give it a raise as it keeps taking a downward surge
      at the turn of every semester.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This G.P., which has in recent times, become
      the final academic determinant of every student on our campuses today, is
      what separates the successful students from the unsuccessful ones in
      school, no matter how smart or intelligent the student may be. It is a
      major determining factor of what a student graduates with, first class or
      third class. When it is on the rise, every student is happy, knowing he is
      on his way to clinching a first class and graduate grandly. However, when
      it is on the decline, students become worried to the bone, knowing surely
      well that they are travelling the path of a third class; an academic
      qualification looked down upon by the generality of the academic community
      and the general populace.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">So many parents even believe, contrary to
      reality though, that the G.P. is the difference between the hardworking
      students who face their studies squarely and the lazy ones who are just in
      school to waste their parents’ hard earned money on irrelevant things and
      riotous living.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As powerful as it has become, this G.P. has
      constituted academic problems to so many students, and this, to so many
      others, has translated into emotional problems. Some students have even
      concluded that it is a problem that can only be resolved by supernatural
      means. So they have resulted to taking spiritual actions. They fast, pray,
      and consult people, who in their best opinion, are closer to God and have
      a higher spiritual antenna for quick sensitivity, so as to tell them the
      minds of God on what else to do to make their G.P. blossom.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Every student who ever gained admission into
      any college or higher institution, be it a university, polytechnic,
      mono-technic, or college of education, to study any course of his choice,
      most times always begin in their first year with a very strong desire to
      graduate with good results. They aspire for a First Class, or at worst a
      Second Class Upper. It is not very common to see a student who just got
      admitted into college who has a desire to graduate with a Third Class or a
      Pass. Every one of them wants good grades. Their hopes are high, their
      zeal is strong and the challenges ahead look surmountable because their
      determination is real. But somehow, somewhere along the line, things do
      not really go as they planned.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Over the years, statistics have shown that
      after the first session’s result is released, a lot of those who desire to
      have a first class result find themselves struggling to keep their stand
      on a weak base of 2:1, and those whose target is 2:1 scarcely meeting up
      with the 2:2 requirements. Not ready to quit easily or give up their long
      term desire to graduate with good grades, they summon up enough courage in
      the second session so as to correct the ills of the first session. But
      alas, only very few get to cross over the boundary of the limitation that
      has been created after the first session. The others take a further
      downward slide.</p>
	  
	  
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Then comes the third session of school: This
      is the beginning of the problem for a lot of students. Discouragement sets
      in as there is no longer any tangible source of motivation. Half of their
      academic calendar is gone and there is no hope of salvaging the situation.
      Some even try to start afresh by changing their departments and their
      courses of study, as though that will permanently solve the problem of the
      acute downward sliding G.P., but alas, this method, though productive to a
      few, has not helped too many.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This may not sound very spiritual to the
      religious minds, but it is the sincere truth, established by the
      scriptures itself. When it comes to boosting your G.P., either the S.G.P.
      (Semester Grade Point) or the C.G.P. (Cumulative Grade Point), fasting and
      prayers alone have not performed the needed signs and wonders most
      students expects it to. Students who have resolved to this alone, or
      coupled with this, consulted other forms of supernatural powers, without
      engaging in the other things they needed to do, some of which we will
      address after now, have found out too late that it really does not help as
      much as they desire that it should. They graduated with the least expected
      result. The reason is simple; the problem was not caused by lack of
      prayers, so the solution is not in praying alone, they will need to take
      necessary actions. Faith, without commensurate works, according to the
      scriptures, is dead faith.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The earth is governed by rules; these rules
      are called natural laws. These rules work irrespective of location, race,
      religion and colour. An example is the law of gravity which states that
      whatever goes up comes down. Irrespective of the place, the personality of
      the person in question, and his religion or colour, whoever decides to
      jump down from a twenty five story building unaided will, at least, break
      his limbs, among other things. This is a natural law that all living
      beings obey.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As there are so many of such natural laws
      that govern the earth generally on daily basis, so also are natural laws
      that govern academics too, which most times are either not known to
      students, or known but unconsciously neglected and not taken too serious.
      This is the core of most students’ problems with their G.P. It is either
      because of something they need to do which they consciously or
      unconsciously are not doing, or something they need not do which they
      constantly find themselves doing, either with delight or under duress.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is the essence of this book; to open
      your understanding to these things in order that your G.P. will become
      better by the end of this semester, and better than that the next
      semester, so that you can clinch a first class degree at the end of your
      academic degree on this campus. It really does not come naturally, but it
      is achievable. It only takes a conscious effort to give it what it takes
      so as to get the best of it. If you are ready to put in the necessary
      sacrifice, you cannot but partake of the imminent harvest.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Discussed in seven detailed chapter
      hereafter are some of the vital things you will need to cross check and
      ascertain that you really are doing as expected. These seven, are the
      constant habits of highly effective students that make it looks as though
      they are extra brilliant. It is these same habits that constantly boost
      their G.P. and if you also will employ them, they are certainly going to

                <h4 style=" text-align: justify;"><b>SERIOUSNESS WITH CLASS ATTENDANCE</b></h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The first of the seven habits of highly
      effective students is the unalloyed attention they give to their lectures.
      They attend all of their classes religiously and take the lectures so
      seriously.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Attendance at all of the lectures organized
      by the school in a particular semester may not always be very convenient
      for students, especially with their other seemingly-more-important
      schedules. In fact, most students really do not understand why they should
      be present at all classes in the first place. Many students wonder: “Why
      must we sit in a class, listening to rhetoric from a boring lecturer who
      is not as charismatic as our pastors in church or our MC’s at social
      functions, when we can as well read the topic from the school’s
      recommended textbooks for the course?”</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Students naturally want something
      interesting and exciting, hence their preference for parties, clubs,
      games, social gatherings and the likes. Academic lectures do not really
      fall into this category! Some of the lecturers are dull, the lectures are
      wearisome, classmates are annoying, the environment is irritating, the
      assignments burdensome and everything put together is mind-numbing.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Majority of students decide not to attend
      these lectures because of these. Some of the few who do, unconsciously
      make a mental selective roster of which course to attend and which not to!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As unreasonable as it may sound, this act of
      boycotting lectures is so popular in so many schools around this part of
      the world so much that it is given an appellation - ‘stabbing lectures’.
      This, in the literal sense, means, using a sharp object to pierce the
      lecture until life is snoozed out of it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you think an average student takes his
      lectures very serious, then you really do not know much about the students
      in this generation. If the attendance of the same class is taken and
      compared during a normal lecture period and during the period of a class
      test, not to talk of the examination day, this statistics become clearer.
      It will surprise you to know that students who sit to write the test are
      always about twice or thrice the number of students who attend the same
      lecture. The lecture hall is always fuller when tests are to be written
      than during lectures. The statistics could be worse, all depending on a
      number of factors.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>REASONS STUDENTS ‘STAB’ LECTURES</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Although it is very imperative that students
      must attend their lectures, but most lecturers do not know that students
      have a choice as to which lectures to attend and which not to. Some of the
      factors that determine their choice of attendance at a particular lecture,
      and whether they will attend regularly and punctually are:</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(1) The Lecturer’s Delivery Style</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most students, considering their age group,
      are very active in nature. Their energetic nature reflects in all they do,
      including the type of presentations they listen to. When a lecture is
      boring, students easily, naturally lose interest in both the lecture and
      the lecturer. Once this interest is lost, the serious minded students
      choose to attend the lecture for routine sake, forcing themselves to
      concentrate in class, while the ineffective students see this as a good
      excuse to absent themselves from the class.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is why the delivery style of a lecturer
      has a lot to do with student’s attendance at his lectures. Some lecturers
      are so interesting to be with that you feel sad to see their lectures come
      to an end while some are so boring that whatever they say sounds like a
      lullaby in your ears and your natural reaction is to want to begin to
      sleep in class. Some lecturers are very lively and can make dull lectures
      sound exciting by the way they teach the students; they are quite
      charismatic in nature. However, there are also unexciting, monotonous
      &amp; nauseating lecturers who can make interesting topic sound
      uninteresting, not because they do not know what they teach, but because
      their manner of presentation may not be that which endear the students to
      want to keep attending their classes excitedly. Effective students compel
      themselves to attend all lectures, irrespective of the delivery style and
      the presentation of the lecturer.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(2) How Confusing The Topic Is</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some topics in the syllabus are easy to
      understand. However, some topics need much more than attending the class
      to understand them. You will need to go over the class notes again and
      again before it makes little sense to you. At times, when teaching these
      topics, even some lecturers get confused in the presence of the students.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Worse still, some courses as a whole are
      just like these. Some courses are so easy to understand while some can
      only be described as confusing, whichever way you decide to see it. Aside
      the lecture hours, students need to devote substantial time to the study
      of such courses in order to have at least a vague idea of what the course
      is all about. Most lecturers handling these types of courses do not make
      things easier for the students also, either because of their manner of
      approach or shallowness in the course. Such courses make students detest
      attending lectures since they gain little or nothing from the lecture.
      They prefer to stay in their dormitories and read the topic from their
      textbooks on their own.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(3) The Comfort Of The Lecture Theatre</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Everyone wants comforts, and if given a
      choice, will prefer to stay in a very comfortable lecture room. When
      students are crowded in a small lecture theatre where there are not enough
      seats, not enough ventilation, and they hardly hear whatever the lecturer
      says, it affects their interest in what they learn and can discourage them
      from attending same class again. However if the class is comfortable
      enough, aside the lecture, the comfort is enough enticement to make one
      want to attend the class.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(4) The Time Of Lecture</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The time of the day the lecture holds also
      affects students’ attendance. Most students will not want to miss morning
      lectures, if it is not too early, say at dawn. Most afternoon lectures
      will witness low turnout compared to the mornings. The evenings will be
      worse, especially for full time students who have been in school all day.
      Any flimsy excuse is good enough reason for them to abandon such lectures.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(5) How Firm The Lecturer Is</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Lecturers who are very jovial and who play
      around with students will witness a larger turn out of students in their
      classes compared to those who are strict and do not tolerate any of the
      students’ excesses.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Left to the jolly, good-humored and carefree
      ones, students can choose to walk into the lecture hall at whatever time
      during the lecture period, as long as it does not disturb the class, the
      lecturer will not complain. However, if the lecturer is an authoritarian
      who does not condone indiscipline, students who arrive late for the
      lecture may prefer to completely stay away from the lecture hall than face
      the wrath of such lecturer for coming late, or for being excessively
      irresponsible during lecture.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(6) How Much Class notes &amp; Assignment
      The Lecturer Gives</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some lecturers really do not teach in class.
      The only thing they use their lecture period to do is to dictate the
      lecture notes and ask students to copy back in their notes these
      dictations. Majority of the time that should be spent teaching is wasted
      on this, and then a take home assignment is given after that. Most
      students will gladly miss these types of lectures, knowing that they have
      really missed nothing; they can always choose to copy the note from
      friends who attended the lectures at some other times.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(7) How Much Academic Weights The Course
      Carries</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The values of the courses offered in the
      higher institutions are defined by their units. These units determine the
      weight of the course. The course with a high unit will bear more weights
      than the course with low units. Some students will prefer to take more
      seriously courses with high units to the detriment of the courses with low
      units. They need to be informed that though high unit courses may cause
      the G.P. to soar easily, but a failure in the low unit courses can also
      cause the same G.P. to crash land from whatever heights it has attained.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">These and a number of other numerous
      factors, which to the parents, lecturers or school authority, may seem
      insignificant, but to students are of great importance, will to a large
      extent, determine the rate of students’ yearning to attend these lectures,
      their participation in the lecture hall, and how much they gain from the
      lecture itself.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Students should please note that the excuses
      above are in no way meant to justify students who are engaged in the
      irresponsible act of absconding from lectures at will. Every student
      should bear in mind that, whatever excuse you have for stabbing lectures,
      you are not excusable. If other students in your class can cope despite
      these excuses, and still pass the course in brilliant colors, you will not
      be a wise student if you use these excuses to your own detriment.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>MAKE A RESPONSIBLE CHOICE</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Back then in primary and secondary school,
      it was made compulsory for you to attend all of your classes. This is
      because an Attendance Register was marked by the class teacher on daily
      basis, and your punctuality in class is reflected in your take-home report
      sheet. Aside your Performance in your subjects and your Position in the
      class, it was one of the three P’s that your parents consciously look out
      for in a Report Sheet at the end of each term; Punctuality in school.
      These three P’s - Performance (in your subjects; which is always evaluated
      by your score in the examination conducted in each subject), Position (in
      class; always rated from 1st to last, the last equating the total numbers
      of students in the class) and your Punctuality (in school) - will
      determine if you will enjoy the holiday period, and how much enjoyment
      will accrue to you before the holiday is over.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Here in the higher institution, there is a
      higher level of freedom which is not experienced in college days. The
      school authority believes an undergraduate should be psychologically
      mature enough to make responsible choices that will take his life forward.
      However, most students abuse this freedom of choice given to them at this
      level of their life by choosing not to attend some lectures. Do not join
      them to employ the power of your choice negatively.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Irrespective of your excuse for not being
      eager to attend your classes, you should always bear in mind that if you
      must excel in your academic pursuit, you must be willing to put aside
      those excuses, no matter how tenable they sound, and do what you need to
      do in school, so as to get what you desire to get out of school.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is not just about schooling, it is a
      major theory of life. Everyone who ever succeeded, either as a student on
      campus or as an adult off campus, had numerous excuses not to, but their
      success was paramount to them than the excuses that surrounded them. You
      also will have to make a choice; which of the two is your priority, your
      success or your excuses?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Before making your choice, remember that the
      reason the school system includes these lecture periods in the school
      schedules is to make life easy for you. Although, most students</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">will argue this! They prefer to agree that
      some lectures make life more difficult for them. However, this really is
      not true. If it is, the academic community would have discovered this over
      the years, and would have wiped it out of the school curriculum; their
      primary purpose is not to make life difficult for you today, but to make
      it easier for you in the future. The education board has no just cause to
      ask you to attend lectures if you will not benefit from it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If schooling looks highly challenging for
      you today, it is to make life less challenging for you tomorrow. If it
      inconvenient you today, it is to make you enjoy tomorrow. These challenges
      and difficulties are the little sacrifices you need to make for a
      stress-free future. So, take your lectures more seriously than you have
      been taking it. A high percent of students who fail in examinations fail
      because they are not serious in attending their lectures. Whatever excuse
      you have to stab your lectures, no matter how appealing the excuse may
      sound, do not give in to it. Attend all of your lectures as much as it
      lies in your power to.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some students are of the opinion that there
      is no big deal in missing lectures if you can find enough time to sit
      down, copy the class notes and then read the topic treated during that
      class period on your own from various textbooks. Nice reasoning this is.
      But this they seldom do. If they mistakenly miss a lecture period, rather
      than ask one of those who attended the lectures to teach them what the
      lecturer taught, and duplicate the notes he gave them in class for their
      own personal study, they keep postponing this until it is about a week to
      the examination period.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">At this time, they most likely will have so
      much academic workload to cover that they consciously neglect such
      accumulated topics and only dwell much on the few topics they have time to
      study, believing God strongly that no question will come out of these
      areas they are yet to learn. More often than not, they get disappointed in
      the examination hall when they see the questions from topics they have not
      read dominating the pages of the question papers.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Read all the textbooks and the study
      materials you can lay your hands on if you can, but please, do not neglect
      this one thing; attend your lectures too! If you decide to read textbooks
      alone, you will spend precious time reading a lot of academic junks and
      irrelevant facts, some of which you will never need, either for your
      present examination or for your practice after graduation.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Your lecturer has been in the system for so
      long and so knows what is relevant and what is not. He only sieves out
      what is important to you and leaves out all the junks, saving you enough
      time and energy. Much more than this, if your lecturer is the one
      composing the examination questions and marking the answer scripts, you
      may not find it so easy if you constantly miss his lectures and you think
      you can make up for it by reading a textbook which was written long before
      you were born!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you attend such lecturer’s class, you
      will easily note the areas the lecturer lays much emphasis on. These areas
      are what brilliant students tag as AOC (Areas of Concentration) when they
      prepare for his examination. You will discover the subtopics he is
      carefully leaving out and the ones he is so excited about. This will be a
      basic guide for you to know what to read and what not to waste your time
      on, when you finally decide to settle down to read study-materials and
      textbooks to garner additional facts so that you will not be reading
      amiss.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some of these textbooks and study materials
      may not really be as explanatory as your lecturers are. The books are not
      specifically written for your community; it is written for a larger
      audience, the international community, and no matter how comprehensive it
      is, it may not really meet your specific needs, especially when it comes
      to applying it to your immediate community. You will need to start
      relating the facts you read with what is obtainable in your community
      yourself. This is an additional stress for you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Your lecturer on the other hand will give
      you down-to-earth examples that you can relate with. He will use images
      and factors that you see around you on daily basis to facilitate your
      understanding. He will excite your memory by making the lessons relevant
      to the day-to-day activities in your community such that the lecture comes
      alive in you and it becomes difficult to forget the important points in
      such lectures.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In some cases, due to the multifaceted
      nature of the topics treated in class, some of the students who even
      attend these lectures may not fully understand the totality of all that
      the lecturer says in the class. Some of them may need to go back to read
      the lecturer’s note over and over again, or better still, get a better
      colleague or a senior student to clarify confusing points to them. If this
      is the lot of those who attend the lectures, one wonders what fate then
      befalls those who refuse to. Some of these topics are better understood
      when taught than when read alone and may give you serious headaches if you
      depend on your textbooks alone when you miss such topics.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Aside wasting unnecessary energy to read by
      yourself what you could have been taught by the lecturer, refusal to
      attend classes is also wastage of funds. Unknown to some students, before
      each semester begins, students are made to pay for each classes they are
      meant to attend. This fee, commonly called ‘tuition fees’ in some schools,
      is, in addition to other fees, called ‘school fees’ in others. What sense
      does it make then to pay for a facility without maximizing its use? It is
      tantamount to wastage.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">From experience, one can say most students
      who miss lectures, (or who stab lectures as they commonly say in our
      institutions) do so for no just cause! They actually have no serious
      excuse for doing so. Majority of them feel they do not need the lectures
      because they presume they already know what the lecturer will teach. Some
      simply feel it is a waste of their precious time. Some do not just like
      the lecturer’s face and some just feel they really do not have any reason
      to attend it. All the excuses they may want to give, including the ones
      highlighted before now in this book, are not strong enough to miss
      lectures already paid for by their parents.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is discovered that students who miss
      lectures really do not do anything of value during the time meant for the
      lectures they missed. Nothing significant is achieved during that period.
      They sleep, watch films and listen to foreign musicals, or chat with other
      friends online or real life, during the period of the lecture. Before they
      know it, the lecture period is over without achieving anything worthwhile
      during that period; they have just wasted the time. Other students who
      attended the lectures will return from the class and still meet them at
      the same point where they left them, doing nothing, wasting away. What a
      stupid way to live one’s life as a student!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">No matter how busy you are, do not miss your
      lectures. Do not become a prodigal son, wasting your precious time and
      your parent’s financial investment on you. Do not wait till the middle of
      the semester before you start to attend lectures. Do not think serious
      lectures starts</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">only few weeks before the examination
      period. Start attending all of your lectures the very day the lecturer
      starts coming to class.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>TIPS TO IMPROVE YOUR ATTENDANCE AT
        LECTURES</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1. DISSOCIATE FROM FRIENDLY ENEMIES</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There are so many friendly enemies in
      school; these are people whose relationship with you will not help your
      academics in any way, rather it will increase the rate at which your
      academic performance keeps plunging downwards. This is because of the
      things they will introduce you to, and the ones they will introduce to
      you. Break communications with such people, primarily those who do not
      encourage you to attend lectures.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you watch carefully, you will notice some
      people whose company you naturally find difficult to leave when it is time
      for lectures. They will not attend their own lectures and will discourage
      you from going for yours. They make it very convenient for you to boycott
      your lectures by giving you every needed reason under heaven why you must
      do so. In the presence of such company, your G.P. can not be salvaged.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">They may come as your roommates, classmates,
      course-mates, fellowship-mates, friends, or just senior colleagues;
      whoever they are does not matter, as long as you notice that all they do
      is to discourage you from giving your lectures your full attention, then
      breaking away from them is the only way to safeguard your academic
      destiny. (For more on these friendly enemies, get the author’s book
      JAMBITE: WHAT EVERY FRESHER NEEDS TO KNOW, where he discusses 18 types of
      relationships you must not keep on campus)</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2. DECIDE TO CHANGE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Make a serious commitment and determination
      not to miss any of your lectures again from today on, and be faithful to
      this pledge. Nothing substantial happens to one in life until one, of his
      own volition, determines to take necessary actions without being forced
      to. Make up your mind to start to attend all your lectures.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Once your mind is made up, the willpower to
      achieve this dream comes with ease, the whole of your body system
      cooperates together to see the fulfillment of your desires, and
      distractions will of themselves melt away, allowing you ample time to
      attend to your lectures at regular times.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">3. PLAN YOUR LECTURES</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Have a complete time-table of all of your
      lectures for the week/semester handy, pasted either by your bedside, in
      your wardrobe, or kept in a small sheet inside your wallet where you can
      have easy access to it any time of the day. You can also have a spare copy
      inputted in your cell phone, since you likely carry it around everywhere
      you go.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Plan each of your days ahead so as to allow
      time for all lectures, interesting or otherwise. Plan your daily
      activities in such a way that every other extra-curricular activity will
      not disturb or override your lecture periods; your lectures must take
      priority in your personal time-table.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">4. REORGANIZE YOUR SCHEDULES</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Plan your other schedules for the day.
      Constantly making impromptu decisions on what to do next in the course of
      the day will unconsciously jeopardize your determination not to miss</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">lectures again, since anything can come up
      during the day which may seem more important than your lectures as at the
      time or emergence.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, at the start of each day, note
      down all the major tasks that you must of necessity accomplish in the
      course of the day and consciously schedule a perfect time for them on your
      time table, being careful not to allow any of it clash with your lecture
      periods. Reschedule ahead of time every other activity that will require
      your attention during the time of the lectures.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most people are not aware of this; no matter
      how busy you get, you will always have time to do all that you really need
      to do if you properly schedule your time. The problem is that most people
      do not have the patience to take out some few minutes a day in order to
      plan for a productive 24hours. More of this planning is discussed in
      chapter 4 of this book.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5. BE PUNCTUAL IN CLASS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Attend all of your lectures when you are
      supposed to. Do not just attend regularly; make it a point of duty to
      attend punctually. Punctuality, they say, is the soul of business.
      Whatever is worth doing at all is not just worth doing well, it is also
      worth doing at the right time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some lectures take place at a fixed venue
      all through the semester; others change lecture rooms from time to time.
      Whichever is the case, be very sure of the venue of the lecture before the
      lecture time and make sure you are always around the venue of the lecture
      well before the stipulated lecture time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you have not found your way close to the
      venue of the lecture before it begins, the thought of the distance to
      cover, in the little time you have before the lecture starts, may become a
      discouraging factor. So always make sure that whatever you have to do
      about thirty minutes before a lecture starts, as much as possible, is done
      at the venue of the lecture or somewhere close by. Being so close to the
      lecture hall at the lecture time will encourage you to attend the lecture.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">6. SETTLE DOWN</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Relax yourself in class before the lecturer
      comes in. Running into the hall and trying to scramble for a seat after
      the lecturer begins his lectures does not befit a serious student. Aside
      distracting other students from concentrating, you will also disturb the
      flow of the lecturer. He may not complain about this, especially if he is
      the nonchalant type, but he will not be too happy with you for the
      distractions you cause during his lecture. The best thing is to make sure
      you are already seated before he comes, with all the materials you need
      ready at hand. This will enhance your concentration and your assimilation.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">7. GET A GOOD LOCATION</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Locate a good seat in the lecture hall where
      you will be able to hear all he says and see all he writes on the board.
      If you come in late, you are likely not going to get a very comfortable
      seat; these would have been occupied by the early-birds and you will be
      left with no choice than to manage whatever seat you get.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Worse still, especially for a very crowded
      class, you may be unlucky to get seats when you are late and may have to
      stand all through the period of the lecture, be it an hour or two. The
      discomforts experienced can discourage you from attending such lectures
      next time. So, get</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">to class early enough so you can seat in a
      place where you will be able to hear every word the lecturer has to say in
      a relaxed position.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Attend all your lectures at a good time so
      you can get a good seat in a good place that will aid a good class
      attention and encourage a good class participation, which will transmit
      into a good performance in the examination and earn you a good grade.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">8. CONCENTRATE IN CLASS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not just attend the class; concentrate.
      The point of focus here is not just being present physically in classes
      alone simply as a way of marking the register; it is much more than that.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">More importantly is your concentration level
      during these classes. Of what use is attending a class you will gain
      nothing from? One major way to gain maximally in class is to concentrate
      fully. The only way to concentrate fully is to listen attentively. The
      only way to listen attentively is to remove all distractions from around
      you and focus on the lecturer alone. You will read more about distractions
      in class and how to handle them in the next chapter.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">9. PARTICIPATE IN CLASS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Participate actively in class. Take note of
      all the important points discussed by the lecturer and write them down
      when you have to. Answer questions when you know it. Do not think someone
      else should. You do! Make intelligent calculative attempts when you do not
      have the direct answers to questions asked by the lecturer. Other students
      may think you are being stupid but the lecturer will see your sincerity
      and your willingness to learn and will take special interest in you. That
      is the beginning of your academic success.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Have the same attitude to practical,
      laboratory works, field works and workshops. These four also are part of
      your school work. They are lectures too, though informal. You will need
      the experience garnered here, if not for the examination you will write in
      school, someday it will be required of you on the field in the nearest
      future. So make sure you participate actively in all.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>IN CONCLUSION</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Having the right attitude to your lectures
      is the first step to building a good foundation for your Grade Points (GP)
      in school, and also the major step to boosting your Grade Points.</p>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">ACTIVE CONCENTRATION IN CLASS</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is good enough to attend all the lectures
      required of you in a semester, but passing your exams go beyond just
      answering ‘present sir’ to the attendance register after each lecture. You
      have to do much more than just sitting idly in the class. You have to be
      present wholly; spirit, soul and body.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is, somehow, very difficult for so many
      students to do. This is why you will see some students who religiously
      attend all their classes but still fail in the examination. The problem is
      not beyond the natural. It is not any attack from home or from their
      father’s wives. The problem is lack of concentration in class.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The ability to sustain their concentration
      during lecture periods is one of the most challenging skills that
      students lack. It is possible to sit in class and not be
      present in class. This may sound ironical, but it indeed happens,
      especially to most students, and sadly, most of the time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is possible to get bored easily in class.
      Many of the lectures you will be required to take will present to you new
      topics on daily basis, some of which may likely not be too fascinating.
      Hence, you lose interest so fast that before you know it, your mind is
      beginning to wander away to some other seemingly important issues which
      are not too urgent and can be delayed till a later time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">At such point, it can be said that you are
      no longer present in class again, since your interest is lost and your
      mind is shut! All that can be seen is your bodily form, but your
      intellectual awareness that is of a greater paramount to the lecture at
      hand, is far from where your body is.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You may likely remember a number of times
      you have found yourself in this situation. The chalkboard in your lecture
      hall just transforms itself to your television screen at home and you
      begin to see a replay of your favorite soap operas or the last movie/home
      video you watched, all of these happening right there in the classroom. It
      is even possible to begin to watch a football match from the chalkboard
      while the lecturer is still teaching. These distractions can also come in
      so many other ways: Some may begin to think of their boyfriend’s last
      letter, their girlfriend’s demands, secret cult’s requirements and
      assignments, economic situation of the country, family problems and
      challenges, politics, sports, dates, comparison of suitors, or any other
      after-school activities.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This becomes more interesting because no one
      notices your absence aside you: Although you are seated with them in the
      class, but you have traveled miles away from them. You are only there in
      fleshly form, but the whole of your system, the most vital parts, are
      somewhere else. Some of these wandering thoughts may not be bad in
      themselves, some may be honorable and reasonable, but the problem is that
      you are not doing the right thing at the right time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Every time you find yourself at such points,
      you are no longer aware of any thing that happens in the class again. You
      are in a separate world, a world where the invisible becomes visible and
      the unreal becomes real, and, like Alice in Wonderland, you are the only
      one, out of the whole class, who is in this World of Fantasy, seeing
      imaginary visions and enjoying unrealistic adventures.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">For some, this illusion could be a brief
      transient period of few seconds from which they recover early enough to
      catch the lecturer’s next statement. However, for most, it could take a
      longer time before they realize they are long gone away from the class.
      Most times, it always takes a shout from the lecturer to bring them back
      to the world of reality. “What was the last statement I made?” the
      lecturer asks them, after noticing from their stares that they have
      wondered away in their thoughts. This they always have no answer to since
      they did not hear a word of it, and this always leads to embarrassing
      moments in class.</p>
	  
	  
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This loss of concentration for some group of
      students occurs in a more active pattern. When they get bored with a
      lecturer’s teachings during a class, they intentionally do all kinds of
      unthinkable things to keep themselves busy for the rest of the lecture
      period, knowing fully well that walking out on the lecturer will incur his
      wrath and put their names in his blackbook.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is why it is common place to see
      students writing love letters to lovers, listening to musicals or watching
      video clips from their phones, doing assignments or copying the lesson
      notes of another lecture while the lecturer is still in class. This is
      their best way of keeping themselves active in class so that they do not
      fall into the temptation of joining the class of students who
      “travel-out”, dose off or actually sleep in class when the lecture becomes
      boring. At least, they feel, doing something active that takes their mind
      away from the lecture during the lecture periods will keep them awake for
      the period of the lecture.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There is, worse still, the group of students
      who plays with other students beside them and those who disturbs the class
      when the lecture is still on. This class disturbance can come in various
      forms, distractions, jests, mockery, noise, and the likes. Whichever way
      it comes, this disturbance is strong enough to take the attention of the
      lecturer and the rest of his students away from the lecture for a brief
      moment in order to attend to the source of the disturbance.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">All of the distractions discussed above
      always lead to loss of concentration in class. It is important to note
      here that, the one who is in class but refuses to concentrate in class is
      not better than the one who did not attend the class. Both of them get
      nothing meaningful out of the class. The one who is not in class is even,
      in a sense, a little better off than the one who is in class but did not
      concentrate. He has complete control over what he does with his time at
      that moment while the other is forced to stay in class under the control
      of the teachers. This is why every student must strive to reduce, if not
      totally eliminate all forms of distractions ever before starting a lecture
      period.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Of what use is your being present in class
      all day if you do not listen to most of what the lecturer has to say.
      Whatever is worth doing at all, they say, is worth doing well. If being in
      class is worth the effort, then you should be there in such a way that you
      will benefit from all that being there has to offer. To be present in
      class, you have to be present in spirit, in soul, and in body. Partial
      presence does not benefit anyone.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Every student who has ever fallen into the
      category of those who either disturbs himself or others from concentrating
      in class has always live to regret it because, at the end of the day, his
      eyes becomes open to the great evil he has done to himself. Most of them,
      from past experience, have had to reseat the lecture and retake its
      examination, which means carry-over in the course.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">SPEECH THOUGHT DIFFERENTIAL</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you desire to become a high flyer in your
      academics, you must learn how to hone your concentration skills, or else,
      it could work against your success. In order to learn how to improve your
      concentration skills, you need to know why people always lose
      concentration during speeches.</p>
	  
	  
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If asked, most students do not know the
      reason why they find it very easy to go into a mini - mental - vacation
      during lectures. The reason is not too farfetched. Science has lately</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">discovered that for an adult, the Average
      Speech Speed is 150 to 250 words per minute (wpm). However, the brain can
      process between 400 to 800 words per minute (wpm). This is called the
      Average Thought Speed.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The difference between this Speech Speed
      (150 to 250) and the Thought Speed (400 to 800), called the Speech Thought
      Differentials, is what is responsible for most students’ loss of
      concentration during lecture periods. Since most public speakers,
      including lecturers, seldom go beyond 250wpm, and the brain, at any point
      in time during a lecture, has the capacity to process up to 800wpm, there
      is a huge gap of about 550wpm between the rate at which one hears and the
      rate at which one assimilates.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This means that a student listens faster
      than the lecturer speaks and is able to reason about three to four times
      quicker than he hears. There is always enough time in between the wordings
      of the lecturer and the thoughts of the students for the students’
      attention to be pulled away from the major task at hand into the pool of
      other things that demands their attention.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is why it is quite easier for one to
      drift off into Wonderland while in class than to sustain one's
      concentration (and most students always do; you have a personal testimony
      to this, unless you do not want to tell the truth). It takes a lot of
      discipline and conscious efforts to keep one's spirit, soul and body
      together in one piece during lecture, especially the unexciting ones.
      Highly successful students will intentional make the conscious efforts,
      and so will get the best of the lecture, while the other students will
      leave things to fate, and will always fall a victim of the mini - mental -
      vacation.</p>
	  
	  
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is because they do not work effectively
      at deliberately controlling what happens during the Speech Thought
      Differential gap. Your ability to concentrate maximally in class will be
      determined by the grip you have on what happens during these Speech
      Thought Differential period. It is the major reason why concentration is
      lost during lectures.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Discussed below are things you need to do in
      order to maximize this Speech Thought Differential Gap. Some of them are
      things you need to do before the lecture begins, some during the lectures,
      while others, at the end of the lectures.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">HOW TO INCREASE YOUR CONCENTRATION LEVEL</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1. BE DETERMINED</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Nothing worthwhile is done in life without
      determination. You will need to intentionally make up your mind to want to
      concentrate. The mind is like a field where weeds and seeds are allowed to
      grow together unless carefully cultivated. You have to deliberately decide
      what you allow to grow on yours.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Your mind has to be intentionally trained on
      what and where to focus on per time, or else, it allows free access of
      just anything into it. This training has to be done constantly and
      frequently until it becomes part of you. If you expect your mind to train
      itself to keep concentrating in class without an active involvement from
      you, you will get disappointed from time to time as you will still get
      easily distracted from class.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You have to make up your mind to do it, and
      be ready to force your mind back to class each and every moment it wanders
      away from class when the other parts of your body are still</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">present in the class. You have to treat it
      like a bird; it has to be caged in order not to fly aimlessly around.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2. BE TIMELY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Make this a habit; always get to class early
      enough. Do not let the lecturer get into the class before you do. This is
      not just because it is ideal to do so, but also because you have paid for
      his service and you must enjoy every bit of it (except if you do not pay
      fees in your school).</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">When you come to class early enough, you are
      able to settle down on time and your mind is allowed enough rest before it
      begins to receive the new layers of information which the lecturer is
      about to download for the day.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most lecturers teach in a logical and
      sequential way. When you start up the class with him, hear the first word
      he has to say, and follow his arguments and reasoning, it is easier for
      you to keep your concentration all through the class. But if you miss the
      first few introductory minutes of the lecture because you came late to
      class, you may have missed the basics on which the foundation of the day’s
      lecture is built upon. This way, it is easier to get confused with the
      topic and ultimately to lose interest in whatever he is saying.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">3. PREPARE AHEAD OF THE CLASS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Being excited about the class you want to
      attend, looking forward to it and preparing ahead of time for it has a way
      of helping to increase your concentration level during the lecture.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">So many students do not do this. They only
      attend lectures because they are forced to; either because they do not
      want to be marked absent from class or they do not want to miss any
      emergency test. Emergency tests are tests that students are not
      pre-informed about. They only get to the class to find out that the
      lecturer has a surprise package waiting for them. Do not attend lectures
      for these reasons; attend because there is something you want to gain from
      the class. Look forward to it with great hopes.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">One major way to show that you look forward
      to the class is your level of preparedness for the class ever before the
      lecturer enters the class. Make readily available all the materials you
      will need throughout the lecture in a place you can easily reach during
      the lecture without distracting either yourself or your colleagues in
      class.</p>
	  
	  
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You may also browse through the last class
      note to refresh your mind on what the last lecture was about. Lastly, get
      to the class before the lecturer and make yourself very comfortable;
      comfortable enough to give you the needed luxuries to enjoy the class, but
      not too comfortable to make you begin to doze off. This done, you have
      successfully cut off a good percentage of the distractions you may have
      during the lecture.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">4. BE RIGHTLY PLACED</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Find yourself a good seat in front where
      there are minimal distractions. It is generally believed in this part of
      the world that often times, the most unserious students always sit at the
      rear of the class and their main aim is to cause distractions during the
      lecture.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This could be true considering the fact that
      the class is always so large that the students who sits at the back hardly
      see the board clearly because of the distance between them and the board.
      This is because there are no electronic visual projection and public
      address system, so,</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">it becomes difficult for the
      back-sitting-students to hear the lecturer audibly, coupled with the poor
      visuals.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Aside these audio visual challenges, there
      are not always enough good seats in some of the auditorium. Students who
      come to class late enough not to get a good seat will choose between
      either standing on his feet for the duration of the lecture, or try to
      manage any of the spoilt seats around, since most of the bad ones are
      always packed at the back of the auditorium while waiting to be repaired.
      This may be peculiar to this part of the world.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">For this reasons, most of the best students
      in the class will always strive to get a good seat in front where they can
      face the lecturer directly and read his lips. You hardly find any of the
      bad students in class sit right in front of the lecturer. He intentionally
      looks for a seat at the back where he can perpetuate his wicked acts.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">When your seat is located in front, as close
      as possible to the lecturer, you have unconsciously removed yourself from
      the midst of those who will distract you and encourage your loss of
      concentration. An added advantage is that you get to hear everything the
      lecturer has to say, and you see everything he writes on the board
      clearly, improving your audiovisual participation, which is a major way to
      enhance concentration.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5. CLEAR SOME SPACE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Once you have located a good seat, another
      way to show you are ready for the lecture is to remove from your work area
      everything that is not related to the particular lecture at hand. Do this
      just before the lecturer gets into the class.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You may need to put some of them in the
      locker of your desk, or return them back in your school bag, or just
      anywhere, as long as they will not be seen or heard so that they do not
      distract you. You may also consider silencing your phone, and more
      importantly, keep it away from your sight.</p>
	  
	  
    <p style="text-align: justify;">6. SET YOUR PRIORITY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">One sure way to lose interest in a lecture
      is to keep remembering things you are supposed to have done but have left
      undone. When such thoughts cross your mind during the lecture, it becomes
      increasingly difficult by the minute to keep your mind glued to the
      lecturer’s words. The thoughts pop up every now and then, reminding you of
      the other deadlines that are still unmet and diverting your attention from
      the lecture each time it does. Any of these thoughts, if given enough
      time, can make you go on series of unending mental excursion.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Sincerely, such thoughts are not very easy
      to nib in the bud. The best way to handle them is to learn to manage
      yourself rightly. Immediately you get into the class, before the arrival
      of the lecturer, itemize the things you are supposed to have done but have
      left undone and allocate to each of them specific time when you will be
      free to attend to them exclusively. They may be included in your to do
      list for the day, or any other day, as your weekly schedule will permit.
      This done, your mind is at rest concerning the issues, knowing fully well
      they are as good as done.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you mistakenly leave any out and it pops
      up in your mind during the lecture, rather than worry about it to the
      extent that it now begins to disturb your concentration during the
      lecture, bring out your to do list again and include it on the list
      specifying the definite time to attend to it. When you allocate time to
      pressing issues like this, your mind becomes free of all</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">guilt of undone tasks that may take over
      your thoughts during the lecture period and you are able to focus on what
      is important for the moment, which in this case is your lecture.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">7. DO ALL ASSIGNMENTS BEFORE THE CLASS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Never carry an assignment into the class
      undone. Do all your assignments ever before the class begins. Do not join
      the class of students who replicates other student’s assignments during
      the lecture hours or just few minutes before the submission deadline.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Whether the assignment is for that
      particular lecture, or for the lecture which comes up immediately after
      it, it is not enough excuse to engage in assignment while the lecturer is
      still speaking. It is not meant to be class work; it is to be done outside
      the lecture period.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Rather than copy others, it makes a lot of
      sense to seat down and sort it out yourself. If you just copy other
      students, you will be the most frustrated student if you meet a similar
      question in the examination hall and you do not know how to find your way
      around it. And remember, it is too late at such time to begin to ask for
      help or look for whose script to copy in the examination hall.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">8. TAKE CARE OF ALL EXTERNAL DISTRACTIONS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond clearing your space of distractions,
      there likely may be other external distractions that may be beyond your
      immediate control. These external distractions may come in any form;
      students loitering around the corridor of the lecture theatres, sounds of
      moving vehicles, musical sound from a nearby shop, blasts from the school
      workshop, distracting noise from the school chapel or mosque, interruption
      from the unserious students in class, students whispering beside you
      during lectures, talking, shuffling papers or eating,… … … the list is
      endless.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">From experience, it may be practically
      impossible to regulate or completely eliminate most of these annoying
      external disturbances, especially since you do not have any control over
      the source that produces it. However, if you are really serious about
      increasing your concentration in class, you can make moves that will
      lessen the effects of most of them on your concentration during the course
      of the lectures.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It will not be rude to ask the students who
      are talking beside you during the lecture to lower their voices to a level
      that will not distract you. You paid good money for the lectures and you
      have a right to attend without distractions.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If the lecturer is not audible enough, and
      you feel it may be discourteous to ask him to raise his voice, you may try
      to move your seat closer to where you can hear him better. You owe
      yourself the responsibility to get the best from the lecture you paid for.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">For those you cannot do anything about, you
      can train your mind over time to learn to tune off these external factors
      while focusing on the most important things at hand. This may take some
      time, and the length of such time depends on the individuals involve, but
      it is achievable, with constant practice.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">9. REDUCE ALL INTERNAL DISTRACTIONS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The worst kind of distraction you will
      always need to battle with as a student will not be the external
      distractions from the outside world but the internal distractions from
      your inner being. If your body system is not quiet enough for your mind to
      receive into it what is coming</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">from the lecturer, it will be difficult to
      keep your concentration in the class, and much more difficult to
      understand whatever is being taught. Therefore, it will be important to
      get rid of whatever disturbances that may arise from your body system
      which may distract you during the lecture period.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most times, such internal distractions come
      in the form of divers messages from the body, say, hunger, thirst, cold,
      heat, worries, thoughts of other things, discomforts, headaches, sore
      back, sickness, fear, or other serious emotional reactions. These things,
      when not taken care of before entering the class, can cut you off untimely
      from whatever is going on in the class.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In order to deal with internal distractions,
      you will need to do a lot of preplanning. Some of them, just like the
      external distractions too, may be difficult to eliminate completely, but
      you would need to try as much as possible to reduce their impacts on your
      concentration during classes if you must boost your G.P. If possible, you
      may need to; eat, take prescribed medication, clear off your mind of
      worries, get a sweater to reduce the impact of the cold on you, or
      whatever, just do anything that will help you concentrate the more in
      class. You will be a lot better off for it!</p>
	  
	  
    <p style="text-align: justify;">10. AVOID TECHNOLOGICAL DISTRACTIONS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">So much has been said about distractions and
      how to eliminate them. Endeavor you guard against all of these
      distractions in order to enjoy the best from your classes. Put whatever
      you have read into practice by carefully eliminating all sources of
      distractions around you. One main source of distraction you will also need
      to learn to eliminate is technological distractions.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In this gadget driven world, it is always
      highly tempting to quickly send a text on your phone, reply a ping on your
      Blackberry, tweet or retweet a message on Twitter, share a broadcast,
      accept a friend on Facebook, reply a chat on Whatsapp or 2go, upload a pix
      on Instagram or silently answer a call during the lectures. However, doing
      any of these will portray you as an undisciplined student who does not
      have a good control on his emotions, and who will let anything, either
      important or not, relevant or irrelevant, crash into whatever major task
      that is at hand.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is always disheartening to see many young
      adults having an uncontrollable affair with their phones in the lecture
      halls, while the lecturer is still impacting knowledge necessary for their
      success in the examination. Their phones are always waiting to be picked
      once a caller calls or any alert beeps during lectures. You may argue that
      what you want to do is just going to take a brief time, a very minute
      percentage of the total lecture time, but the truth is, it only shows that
      you have accepted that the brief task is of much value to your life than
      the lecture you have allowed it to interrupt.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Give your phone and other gadgets a break
      once it is lecture time. Do not let them have complete control over you;
      you take charge over them. Do all you need to do with the phone before the
      lecturer comes into the class; then put the phone on silence or vibration
      mode (if you do not want to completely switch it off) once the lecturer
      begins to teach. If it is not switched off, take it away from your table
      and keep it in a safe place, like in the drawer of your desk or in your
      locker, not even in your pocket. This is to avoid the temptation of
      stealing a look once there is a vibration.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You hardly will get any emergency call, so,
      all alerts can be attended to after the lectures. Whatever call you have
      missed while your phone is on silence, you may return the call whenever
      you are through. If you do not have enough call credit, you may just flash
      all the numbers to alert them that you are now available to be reached. If
      your phone was switched off, whichever caller that could not reach you
      then will definitely call back if his message is important. It may sound
      silly, but it helps, and it is good for you. You are not unreachable for
      life, you are just unavailable for few hours, and it is for your progress.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">11. LISTEN ATTENTIVELY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">One major way to increase your attention in
      class, thereby increasing your concentration, is by learning to listen
      attentively. ‘To listen’ may sound so easy to do; however, it does not
      come naturally. Listening is totally different from hearing someone speak.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The word ‘listen’ is a verb, and you still
      remember that a verb is an action word, (at least you were taught that
      definition years ago and you should not have forgotten it now). This makes
      ‘listening’ an action word, a present continuous one. You will need to
      consciously train yourself to listen well in class. This is achieved by
      deliberately ensuring that no word from the lecturer passes your ears
      unnoticed. To ‘hear’ is more passive but to ‘listen’ is more active.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Listening to lectures is different from
      listening to musicals, videos, or a radio program. For such, you may hear
      without listening; words merely pass by you and your ears pick some of
      them by chance and lose some, and you are not bothered a bit about the
      ones you missed. However, when it comes to your lectures, you cannot
      afford to miss anything. You have to intentionally make every possible
      effort to listen to what the lecturer has to say, without missing one
      minute of his words. A minute could be a lot when it comes to information
      dissemination; it is a whole 60 seconds of facts!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Listen and listen attentively. Of all the
      five sensory organs, there is no other major way through which a man hears
      aside the ears. You see with your eyes, feel with your skin, taste with
      your tongue, smell with your nose, but you hear with your ears. It is the
      only part of the body that is assigned with the responsibility of
      listening and hearing. If you are not going to use it during the lecture
      period, then you are not going to gain anything during the period.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Let nothing else engage your ears once the
      lecturer begins to teach. Whoever and whatever competes with your ear
      drums at the same time the lecturer is ready to teach is only competing
      with your high Grade Points (including ear piece connected to gadgets). If
      you really desire to boost your G.P., you must be ready to give your
      lecturer the attention he needs by listening attentively.</p>
	  
	  
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is a general misconception among students
      that when you listen casually you will hear and understand all that is
      said. It is not true. Listening entails a lot of hard works, part of which
      is concentrating. If you are not going to listen attentively well enough,
      you are not going to hear well and you may soon begin to lose
      concentration. If this happens constantly enough, then you are on your way
      to a downward spiraling G.P.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Aside losing concentration, there is nothing
      as embarrassing as asking a lecturer to repeat himself again and again.
      Though once in a while it may be acceptable, but asking more often in a
      lecture can be idiotic.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">So, learn to listen well. Be so attentive
      that you do not notice any movement around you, aside that of the
      lecturer. Focused listening like this makes the speaker feels worthy,
      appreciated, encouraged and respected. Speakers always have more amazing
      facts to share when they discover the people are willing to listen, and
      they reveal things they probably would not have shared, because they are
      encouraged and motivated by the audience’s reactions.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Once you cultivate this habit, over time, it
      becomes an unconscious practice and you can then listen to just anything
      and get just everything.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">12. AVOID MULTITASKING</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Multitasking may seem harmless, especially
      if you are not caught by the lecturer. You may play games on phones, chat,
      copy notes of other lecturers, do an assignment, flip through a magazine,
      and send a text message, while still pretending to listen to the lectures.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you have the ability to do many things
      together at once, it may look okay, but you will be distracting yourself
      from giving your maximum attention to the primary task at hand, and you
      therefore may not get the best from the lecture. When it comes to
      listening to lectures attentively, there is no such thing as multi-tasking</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">13. FOCUS ON THE CONTENT</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Your primary focus during a lecture should
      be the content and not the delivery style of the lecturer. Some lecturers’
      delivery styles can really encourage concentration. Such lecturers are
      always fun to be with and their class is always filled with students. Some
      others can be so discouraging and unwelcoming.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Look beyond such displeasing delivery
      styles. Simply focus on the content of what is being delivered. Pay more
      attention to what is being delivered than how it is being delivered. Each
      time you dwell on how it is being delivered, it may get you discouraged,
      and being discouraged during a lecture is one of the first steps to losing
      your concentration during the same lecture. So, do your best to major on
      content, rather than delivery.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">To major on the contents, learn to listen to
      the right things. You may feel you are concentrating and still miss vital
      points. You may remember a joke the lecturer shared in class but not
      remember the topic of the lecture or the facts discussed. If this happens,
      it means you have actually not listened to the most important things
      during the lecture. You may have to begin to train yourself to listen to
      key points and main ideas. This you can achieve by doing these four
      things:</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A. Listen with the intention to ask a
      question: Prepare to listen in such a way that you can ask the lecturer a
      really brilliant question about the lecture topic he just treated
      immediately after the class. Use the speech thought differential time to
      formulate questions in your mind to ask him, either before he leaves the
      class in the presence of the other students so that they may benefit from
      it or in his office later on in the day. If you listen with this mindset,
      you will unconsciously be forced to concentrate on all that he says.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">B. Listen with the intention to teach
      another: One way to be sure that you understand too well what the lecture
      has taught is to teach others what you have learnt. So, listen with the
      intention that whatever knowledge you gain from this lecture, you are also
      going to impact it on some others. You may even go a step further to look
      for those who are confused and</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">clarify things for them after the lectures.
      Listening with this mindset will help you to a great extent.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">C. Listen as if you are the only one in
      class: The reason most students engage in activities that causes them to
      lose concentration in class is because they feel they are not the only one
      in the class, and so they may hide in the crowd to do things and get away
      with it. If they are the only person in the class, they may actually be
      more careful and more courteous. For example, if you are the only one in
      the class, you hardly will pick a call when the lecturer is teaching, or
      multi-tasks (e.g. play games on your phones, or read a magazine etc). Such
      things can only be done confidently when the class is large. So, forget
      about every other person in the class; see yourself as the only student
      present, and you will behave more maturely naturally.</p>
	  
	  
    <p style="text-align: justify;">D. Predict the lecturer's flow of thought:
      Rather than allow your mind to wander aimlessly all around, give it this
      task: try to predict the lecturer's flow of thought. Anticipate where he
      is going to land his arguments based on where he is coming from. Create a
      relationship between what you already know and what you are learning anew.
      Most lecturers always move from the known to the unknown. Follow his line
      of thought. Create a link between what he is teaching you presently and
      what you have learnt before. If well monitored, this also can help keep
      you focused on the right things to listen to.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">14. TAKE NOTES</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In order to get the best from any gathering,
      formal or informal, you must be willing to take notes. This is because
      your memory cannot be trusted to store too much information per time. This
      is why they say a short pen is better than a long memory. The mind works
      better as a reasoning faculty than a storage disk.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">When the lecturer gives lecture notes in
      class, either he decides to write on the board or he dictates them, take
      the pain to write them down in your own class notes. Do not wait till
      after the lecture before you start to look for some other students’ note
      to copy (or, as the case may be most times, photocopy).</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is better for you to write your own note
      while in class. This will save you the time and energy you will spend in
      writing the note at some other times. Much more, it will also help you to
      concentrate more in class since you will be careful not to miss the note.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">15. TAKE EXTRA NOTE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You will need to take much more than the
      notes the lecturer will dictate to you in class. The lecturer may give you
      a class note to copy. However, from experience, it is not all that is said
      during the lecture that is contained in the lecture notes. Most of what
      the lecturer is going to explain verbally may not find their way into your
      notes. This is because there is not too much time to write all the
      necessary things; a lecture period only last for about an hour except for
      a double period.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There is little that can be covered in one
      hour especially if he has to teach you, illustrate all his cogent points,
      convince you of his arguments, solve past questions as class examples,
      take questions from bothered students, and still dictate notes which he
      expects the students to write, all in the space of just sixty minutes.
      This makes it practically impossible for any lecturer to cover all he
      sincerely wishes to do in the space of an hour.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, the lecturer assumes that you
      will, on your own and in your own spare time, read textbooks and other
      study materials in order to augment the things he has taught and has given
      in the notes. But most times, most students do not do this. To make up for
      this, it is important to note the things the lecturer will say in class
      which he may not include in the notes. Write them on the side margin of
      your note so that you can remember that it is not part of the lecturer’s
      note.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most times, the lecturer’s examination
      questions are taken from the things he says in class which he does not
      include in the class notes, and it takes only those who have noted such
      points in their notes to remember it vividly in the examination hall.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Intentionally watch out for such important
      and relevant points mentioned during lectures but not included in the
      notes. Add them to your own notes. Use the Speech Thought Time Difference
      to write on one side of your class note the vital things that the lecturer
      says which he has either consciously or unconsciously omitted from the
      class notes. You may find them very useful when reviewing the lecture
      notes later. It is one of the things that make the difference between the
      average student and the excellent student.</p>
	  
	  
    <p style="text-align: justify;">16. RESPOND APPROPRIATELY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Whenever you find yourself in class, always
      respond appropriately. Active response during the class is a sure way of
      getting your spirit, soul and body glued to the lecturer. It helps you to
      concentrate fully on the topic under discussion and on the lecturer taking
      it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Let the lecturer notice your presence, not
      by doing stupid and silly things, but by being there any time he needs
      assistance during lecture. This has a way of making your mind concentrate
      the more in class.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Participate fully whenever you are in class.
      It is not just enough to simply pay attention; you need to participate,
      both actively and passively. Ask questions when you do not understand the
      topic being taught. The questions you are going to ask may be questions
      that will clarify confusing points in what has previously been said, or
      that will help the lecturer dig deeper in the topic under discussion for
      the benefit of the whole class.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond asking questions, also make efforts
      to answer questions asked by the lecturer during lectures. Whenever the
      lecturer demand contributions from the students, raise your hand to
      attempt the questions. Do not just leave it to some few brilliant students
      to do.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Get involved. Do not just be a bystander,
      play a part. Engage fully in all class activities. Do not be left out. Do
      not feel too big to participate. Do not feel too insignificant to
      contribute. Do not leave it for the few who always do it; be part of them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">17. KEEP AN OPEN MIND</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Try to keep your mind open. Develop the
      habit of listening with rapt attention anytime the lecturer is around. Do
      not assume you know what he is going to say next. Just listen to him
      first.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not make up your mind before he finishes
      his arguments. Do not begin to agree or disagree when he is still
      lecturing. Direct your focus only on what he is saying. If not, you may
      lose your concentration. Listening attentively does not necessarily mean
      that you will</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">have to agree with everything the lecturer
      says, but it helps you to understand his point of view better, and to see
      if both parties can harmonize their thoughts.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Reserve your criticism. Do not just rush
      into concluding the lecturer is wrong before he ends the class. Keep your
      mind open. Even if you feel the lecturer has said something that you think
      is wrong, Let him die before you bury him. Reserve your judgment until he
      ends his delivery. This will help you to sustain your concentration level
      until the end of the class.</p>
	  
	  
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If after listening, you discover that your
      lecturer’s opinion contradicts what you believe to be right, rather than
      being judgmental, please do him a favor, ponder well on all what he has
      said first. If after that, you still think he is wrong, and you feel the
      need to correct the impression in the hearts of the other students in the
      class, do it in a mature way. Be diplomatic about it. Make sure what you
      are doing is a positive constructive criticism, and not discrediting a
      whole hour of lecture simply because of one statement you do not agree
      with and thereby discrediting the integrity of the lecturer.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you drag your lecturer in the mud, he
      will fight back like a wounded lion, and such fights are always very
      dirty. You need not be told who will be at the losing end: there is a very
      high probability that it is going to be you, through your G.P.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">18. USE BODY LANGUAGE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Concentrating fully on what is being
      communicated during a lecture goes beyond just being present in the class
      where the lecturer teaches; it is an active process which needs constant
      practice to be developed</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not just listen with your ears alone;
      listen with the whole of your body. You can explore your body languages to
      help in consolidating points. If you know how to use it well, your body
      languages can reveal either your interest or your disinterest in a
      lecture. Much more than this, with proper usage, it can also help you to
      sustain your interest in an uninteresting lecture to the end.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">To use it to your advantage, you will need
      to actively involve all of your body parts during the lecture. Do not just
      sit like a dead dog in the classroom. Make some intelligent moves that
      will increase your concentration. Some very common body languages that may
      help students are discussed here, others you may learn as you develop in
      the usage of body languages during lectures.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Learn to apply all these required body
      languages. You may decide to nod your head in affirmation if you hear
      something you agree with. Sit up straight or readjust your sitting
      position if you hear something that is really new or strange. Shake your
      head slightly in disbelief if you really do not agree. Raise your eyebrow
      in surprise when confronted with an alarming fact. Smile when you are
      amused or when you hear something funny. Laugh heartily when it is
      necessary, especially if it really gets at you. As you make eye contact
      with the speaker, turn your head or rotate your chair as he moves around
      the hall. Such intelligent moves and facial expressions can help in
      keeping your mind alert.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">These diverse forms of nervous exercise may
      look irrelevant and unnecessary, but it will always yield a significant
      impact on your concentration level. You may not always be given the chance
      to vocally give an expression to your impressions during a lecture, but if
      you</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">know how to use it, a great deal of
      communications with yourself can be done through body movements and body
      language.</p>
	  
	  
    <p style="text-align: justify;">19. CONTROL YOUR LIMBS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you are one of those who naturally cannot
      control your limbs whenever you are seated in the class, then you may have
      a serious problem with concentration in class. This inability to control
      your limbs is a major bad habit that has to be dealt with.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you find yourselves always playing with
      your hair, playing with rubber bands, tapping on the table, chewing gums,
      drawing cartoon figures on old notes, or biting the lower side of your pen
      during class, you may not know to what extent you are distracting
      yourselves until you do without it for a while and then compare your
      concentration level. Some of these habits may have grown with you over the
      years, but that does not mean you cannot do without them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some of those who engage in these habits do
      it unconsciously and they really do not know that, aside distracting
      themselves, they also constitute nuisance by distracting others. If you
      are one of them, you may have imbibed these habits unconsciously, but you
      must be ready to learn to discontinue them consciously.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">20. HANDLE BOREDOM</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is not unusual to become bored during a
      lecture, once in a while. These feelings of boredom most times do not come
      from either the lecturer or the class, but from the listener. So, the
      problem you have with boredom is you. It may be that you are not really
      focusing on the lecture enough, or you already concluded that you know all
      that the lecturer wants to talk about. Highly effective students do not
      sign out from lectures they already know. They rather will listen more
      carefully to see what new things they can learn.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">To resist boredom during any lecture, make
      use of all of the things discussed in this chapter. In addition to that,
      learn to monitor the lecturer. Focus more on the person in front of the
      class and less on what is going on around you. Keep an eye contact with
      the lecturer. There is a direct relationship between listening and eye
      contact. The more eye contact you can make with the lecturer, the better
      you will listen to him. Do not allow your eyes lose trail of the lecturer
      as he moves from one place to the other in the lecture room. If you can
      engage actively your eyes and your ears, in addition to other things
      discussed before now, you will, to a large extent be able to overcome
      boredom.</p>
	  
	  
    <p style="text-align: justify;">21. FOLLOW THE GOLDEN RULE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, follow the Golden Rule: Do unto
      others as you would they do unto you. How would you love to be treated if
      you were the one in front of the class? What kind of reactions would you
      expect from your listeners?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do exactly that. Be the kind of listener you
      want others to be if you were the one addressing them. Do not do anything
      you will not expect a student to do if you were to be the lecturer. This
      is called The Golden Rule.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">22. RETRACE YOUR STEPS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">After doing all of this, you may still find
      your mind wandering during lectures once in a while. This is because you
      have not been used to controlling your concentration ability before now,
      and merely determining that you want to start concentrating in class from
      today will not do the magic in minutes.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Once in a while, it may still happen! Do not
      worry. Relax. It only means you have not perfected the skills yet. But be
      smart enough to discover on time when you have lost concentration again.
      Each time your mind drifts away from the lectures, or you discover that
      you are not actively listening, be honest enough to admit it. There is no
      use deceiving yourself.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Then do what you need to do to get yourself
      back on track. Refocus your attention immediately you discover you are
      gone. With constant practice, you will be able to sustain your
      concentration for longer periods of time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">ADVANTAGES OF CONCENTRATING IN CLASS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1. YOU GET A FIRST HAND INFORMATION</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Every time you get to class early enough and
      sit close to the board, you get an advantage that most of your friends may
      not get; you get firsthand information of what the lecturer has to say.
      You see clearly, hear audibly, and participate in a better way than most
      of your friends at the back who are still straining themselves to either
      see the board or hear the lecturer.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2. YOU ARE NOT LABELLED A BAD EGG</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The lecturer always know those who are his
      students and those who are just in class because it is important for them
      to attend the lectures before they are allowed to sit for exams. His
      students are the ones who gives him all of their attention anytime he is
      in the class and he, in turn, gives them all of his attention too anytime
      they need him. He treats his students with some level of respect, gives
      them some special concern, and always mark their examination and test
      scripts with great considerations because he is interested in their
      success.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The other class of students who he really
      does not see as his students are those whose attention he does not always
      get in class. These ones are labeled the bad eggs of the class and he
      really does not care too much about them, whether they pass or fail. You
      are in a very terrible state when your lecturer begins to see you as one
      of the bad eggs in class, and if you do not change on time, you may have
      yourself to be blamed for it in the nearest future. And the only way a
      lecturer differentiates his good students from the bad eggs in the class
      is that one concentrates in the class while the other disturbs him in the
      class. Make your choice.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">3. YOU SAVE TIME ON PERSONAL STUDY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">When you have taken your time to do all that
      you are supposed to do during the lecture period, you save yourself so
      much time and energy during the Personal Study Time. All you need do then
      is to read the topic once and your mind will begin to replay the events in
      the classroom just the way it happened on the exact day. You will begin to
      remember everything you were taught on that day, all the questions that
      were asked, all the answers the lecturer gave, all the illustrations he
      did, and almost everything he said.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This will make your personal study session
      more exciting and interesting; saving you the time you would have wasted
      on reading and rereading the same paragraph again. Those who do not
      concentrate in class do not find study time that easy. It is always a time
      of unexciting hard labor as there is practically nothing to fall back on
      in their memory disk. Each topic in their copied notes always look new to
      them, as though they have never heard of it before, and they need to start
      learning everything in their notes afresh! What a waste of time and
      energy.</p>
	  
	  
    <p style="text-align: justify;">4. YOU HAVE EASY ACCESS TO YOUR LECTURER</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Not all students have the boldness to knock
      on their lecturer’s office door to ask him for assistance in clarifying
      unclear points taught in the class. This kind of boldness does not come
      through boldface. It comes only by actively participating in the
      lecturer’s class. This endear him to your heart so much so that when you
      knock on his office door, he does not see you as a stranger, but as a
      willing student whose main aim is to leave the school in flying colors,
      and he is always ready to assist. If you are not an active student and you
      decide to approach your lecturer with boldface, some may be nice to still
      find time and attend to you, but most will turn you down with boldface
      too.</p>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">PRODUCTIVE PERSONAL STUDY SESSIONS</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Passing your examinations, thereby boosting
      your G.P. is not simply a combined issue of attending lectures and
      concentrating in class alone. If it is, no student will ever fail. Once he
      is aware of the fact that all he needs to do to be awarded a brilliant
      mark in the examination by his lecturer is just to present himself in the
      lecture room and concentrate, he takes it upon</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">himself to ensure that the lecturer does not
      get to the class before him and feigns a carriage of a very serious
      student each time in class. He does it with so much zeal and sanctimonious
      attitude that no one notices it is such a pretense. But this is not the
      case.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Although, some post secondary institutions
      in this part of the world award marks for attending classes in order to
      encourage students to present themselves for these lectures, but these
      marks are practically insignificant at the end of the day, considering its
      relative percentage to other factors. The strongest current of the mark
      awarded for attending lectures alone is not strong enough to carry one
      across the boundary that demarcates the successful students from the
      failures.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is why you still find some students who
      ardently and religiously attend all lectures, (even if it holds in the
      space in between Jupiter and Mars at 12:00am; they never missed any day of
      lectures - it is as though they practically ‘live’ in the lecture
      theatre,) but who still do not make it through the examination
      successfully, and you may probably have wondered how they could have
      failed with such a high level of class attendance and examination
      preparation? What then is the problem? This calls for the attention of all
      students.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You may even have a personal testimony to
      support this fact. You will know at least one, two or three of your
      friends who attended lectures more religiously than you did last semester,
      but when the result came out, they were nowhere close to your academic
      performance, measured by your semester result. And it could be the other
      way round anyway. You probably did attend more lectures than they did, but
      you can not boast of the result they had. Something you cannot place your
      hands on went wrong, and you really do not know what it is up till today.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Can we, for this reason, conclude that,
      irrespective of the number of lecture hours you attend in a given course,
      destiny will cause you to pass if you are destined to pass, and you will
      fail if you are destined to? No! This will mean going to the extreme,
      since all other factors are not yet considered.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Attending lectures and concentrating in
      class are important, and that has been discussed in the previous chapters.
      The merits of doing so, and the demerits of refusing to do so have all
      been highlighted. But you need to know that the fact that you attended all
      of the classes and concentrated on the lecturer while doing so may though
      help you grab the best from the lecture, but it will not guarantee that
      you will remember all that the lecturer said in the class when it finally
      stares you at the face in the examination hall.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">We all have differing ability to assimilate
      facts. If you ask two students to stay in the same classroom, on the same
      type of chairs, with the same type of note books and writing pens, under
      the same type of atmospheric conditions of temperature and pressure,
      listening to the same lecture, at the same time, with all other relevant
      factors practically the same, you will notice that one will probably
      understand better than the other. If you decide to put both of them to
      tests as regards what they have learnt in that same period, you will
      realize that one will outperform the other.</p>
	  
	  
    <p style="text-align: justify;">What could be responsible for this? Students
      have different rates of assimilation. This rate of assimilation depends
      on, amidst all other relevant factors, how well he has trained his memory
      over time. That is why you will sit in a class during a lecture, and will
      not understand what the lecturer has said. All he writes on the board and
      says in class is just as</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">though he wrote and spoke in unknown
      tongues. Immediately after the lecture, you may meet your fellow classmate
      who sat in the same class with you, who will re-explains everything to you
      again, and probably, again and again before you now really understand. He
      explains just as though he was a classmate of the lecturer years ago when
      the lecturer himself was first taught the same topic, and he just attends
      the class with you for fun, as though he knows all that the lecturer
      already knows!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This shows that we all do not assimilate at
      the same rate. Although you both were under the same lecture, he got the
      points faster than you did because he has a higher level of assimilation
      at that time. Therefore, the fact that you just attended that class does
      not mean you will always remember all that the lecturer said in that
      class; or that you will pass any exams set on the lecture simply because
      you were just present in the lecture room. Other things need to be done.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Aside the ability to assimilate, we also
      have different ability to remember or recall facts. Ask some students for
      all the names of the teachers who taught them both in primary and
      secondary school and they will answer you as if it was written on a sheet
      of paper and stored in one side of their brain, waiting for you to ask.
      They will not miss out one. Such students may likely remember the name of
      the baby formula they were fed with when they were six months old! But ask
      another student for the name of his last mathematics teacher in secondary
      school and the look on his face reads something like “Do you still expect
      me to remember such an insignificant fact after so many years? How
      relevant is that to my present position now”? He simply has forgotten. He
      is just looking for excuses to cover up his memory lost.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I used to have a classmate who remembers the
      full names and birthdates of everyone in the class, and will go an extra
      length to send a text or mail to everyone on their birthdays. But you also
      know there are a thousand and one students who really can not remember the
      birthdates of everyone in their nuclear family, talk less of their
      extended family. I fall in that category. I once forgot my birthday and
      did not remember until a day after when one of my close friends came to
      apologize for not sending me a birthday card!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This shows that the rate at which we
      remember facts differ from each other. We may attend the same lecture, but
      some students will still remember what the lecturer said and will still
      repeat it verbatim if they are asked to, even if it is a month after the
      lecture, while some have forgotten what the lecturer said immediately they
      stood up and walked out of the class.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In order to make up for this differences in
      individual’s ability to recall and retain facts, it is important that
      every student needs to have a Personal Study Time when he reads all over
      again, as often as possible, whatever it was he was taught in the class.
      This makes the topic fresh in his mind for as long as he is willing to go
      over it again.</p>
	  
	  
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In a research conducted few years ago by a
      foreign university, it was discovered that, for one to see a thing and
      identify it perfectly for what it is, he has to see it for at least
      sixteen times. After seeing it for at least sixteen different times, he
      becomes so used to it that he can identify it anywhere he sees it again,
      even if it is in his sleep.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is what this means. The colour of the
      text you are reading now is black, written on a white sheet of paper. The
      first time you saw something like this, you didn’t know it was called
      black texts on a white sheet. Someone was kind enough to tell you,
      probably your</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">parents, your kindergarten teacher, or
      whoever. You can be sure the second time you saw it, you still forgot, and
      you were reminded again. The third time, you tried to remember a part of
      it, but did not remember everything correctly. Someone still helped you.
      This happened for at least sixteen different times. And now, if you were
      woken from sleep and asked what the colour of the text of this book is,
      you will not think twice to give an answer. This is because you have seen
      it enough times, and it has unconsciously registered itself in your brain.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Every student needs to know how this
      research affects his academics. Knowing this will help you a lot to boost
      your G.P. Most students do not really engage in serious study until when
      examination is close by. When the school just resumes, they feel there is
      not much work load, and so play away their semester. Although they have so
      much ample time to study their class-notes which are not yet so bulky and
      to prepare either ahead of the class or alongside with the class at such
      times, they feel such responsibility is for the “efficos” (the most
      brilliant students) in the class. They just attend their normal classes
      religiously, copy their notes up to date, and keep them in a secure place
      waiting for the examination season before they start to read.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You know how fast time runs. Like the common
      saying, time waits for no one. Two months into the semester, they become
      scared of the bulky class notes and the massive workload before them and
      how much they have to cover. At this time, the rumor of examination time
      table is already spreading like wild fire and the lecturers are already
      announcing periodical tests. This is the time most students begin to
      study.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">At such time, because of the massive
      workload before them, the best they can do is to read their notes just
      once, or at most twice. They really do not have enough time to read over
      and over again until they understand the whole content of the course. So
      when they read, all they do is to cram everything together in their brain.
      With this kind of method, you may of a truth cover all that you have to
      read, but you will be fooled to believe you have understood all that you
      have read.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Spending an entire day cramming just before
      a major exam is not the way to go. Your mockery will become evident to all
      when you get to the examination hall and attempt to answer the questions.
      At first, after reading the question, you will think you know the answer
      since you have read about it once, but when you now start to write down
      the answer, after a statement or two, you will discover there is a break
      in communication between your brain and the hand holding the pen! A
      serious network failure will take place. You can not continue again, you
      do not know the next word or sentence to write.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You decide to leave that question and jump
      to the next, and exactly the same thing repeats itself. You start
      answering the question and along the line, after a statement or two, your
      network server shuts down and you can not continue again. Then you know
      you are in for a serious trouble.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">At this point you are left with one of four
      options:</p>
	  
	  
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(1) Simply drop your pen, submit your work
      and walk right out of the examination room, because it is useless staying.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(2) Sit down and keep fiddling with your
      pen, hoping that before the examination time is over, your server will be
      back online and you will be reconnected back to your network.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(3) Look into your neighbor’s answer script
      to copy from, or ask him to tell you what the next sentence is. This is
      really dangerous, if you are caught, you will face the music.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(4) Pray to God to forgive your act of
      indolence in reading your books when you were supposed to, and ask Him if
      He will be merciful enough to remind you of the remaining answers.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If this has happened to you before, you will
      know the fourth option is the only sensible way out, although not too many
      people tread it. More flow with the second and third option.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The reason you encountered this problem is
      simple. You truly read, but you did not read enough to understand what you
      read. You only read once or twice, and crammed it up, deceiving yourself
      that you have read enough and that you know it all already.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The problem with cramming is this; it will
      deceive you into believing that you have known it all as at the moment of
      cramming. You will even do a perfect job if you tried to recall what you
      have crammed as at the point of cramming. It is still fresh in your mind
      and has not been muddled up with other things you have read, so you can
      still recall verbatim. But after a while, it begins to joggle up in your
      memory, displacing, replacing, and mixing up facts that are not related to
      each other. This is where the problem of cramming begins.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I once met a student who got into problem in
      the examination hall trying to spell ‘was’ as simple as it is. He had
      crammed and over-crammed so much that so much joggling had taken place in
      his brain, and spelling ‘was’ now became a great problem to him. He tried
      all manner of spellings on his question sheet which he showed me later.
      Spellings like ‘wus’, “waz’, ‘wos’, ‘woz’, and the likes were written all
      over the question paper! When he got more confused, he left a blank space
      for it and went ahead with his essay. This is what cramming does to you;
      it betrays you at the moment you need it most.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Never cram as a student. Read over and over
      again until you understand. To cram means to stuff, shove, or fill up
      forcefully into any available place, without any specific or proper order.
      When you read like this, you can be sure that the essence of your reading
      will be defeated, since you will not be able to accurately recall them
      when you actually need them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">To really read and understand, you will have
      to read and reread your notes again and again. If it takes sixteen times
      to identify anything, you also may need to go over each of the topics
      treated in all of the courses you are writing more than twice so that you
      can still remember them, not just in the examination hall, but for life.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is the essence of a Personal Study Time
      and this is why you cannot postpone it till examination time tables are
      released. Start to study immediately school resumes. Make a personal time
      table of what courses to study each day. Now that there is not much
      academic pressure on you, this is the time to study well the few topics
      you have done in class and take them out of the way. If this is not done
      now, as time goes on they begin to pile up until they become an
      insurmountable mountain. Do not give them the chance to. A stitch in time,
      they say, saves nine. If you must boost your G.P., it is not just by
      attending lectures alone, you will also need to study the lecture notes at
      your personal study hour.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the students you know who fail on
      your campus may not be completely guilty of not studying; some actually
      made attempts to take time out for their personal studies. Their challenge
      may be that they do not cover all that they need to during this time. They
      do not study all of their notes comprehensively. They select what topics
      to read, and what topics not to read in particular courses. They feel the
      lecturer may not ask questions from all of the</p>
	  
	  
    <p style="text-align: justify;">topics he taught in the course, and in case
      he decides to do, he will give them alternatives; something like 8
      QUESTIONS, ANSWER 5. So, they only cover the five topics they feel they
      are better at, leaving out the remaining three of the eight topics taught
      in the course of the semester. This is called Selective Study. Sometimes,
      they are lucky to get alternative questions, so they come out successful
      in the examination. But at other times, more often than not, they are
      unlucky to find 8 QUESTIONS, ANSWER ALL. This means doom.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Study is a fundamental requirement in the
      school of excellence; therefore learn to devote time for it. As a full
      time student, study is your full time responsibility. Invest your time in
      your study. Invest your skills in your study. Invest your efforts in your
      study. Invest your finance in your study. Read all available information
      that is relevant and necessary to the improvement of your performance in
      all of the courses you are taking this semester. One day, it will yield
      great dividends for you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You are not a second class student. You
      really do not know how well you can perform until you have studied to the
      best of your ability. Do not let anyone classify you among the dullards in
      your class. You can be better than this. Your result can be better than
      what it was last semester. You can switch over. You can cross the
      mountain. Your G.P. can receive a powerful boost, if only you are going to
      do what is needed to do to experience it; sit down and study your notes
      well before examination starts.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Those who get better results than you do not
      have better brains than you. They only study more than you do. Science has
      discovered that, irrespective of colour, race, nationality, or whatever,
      every man’s brain is the same size, same colour and same texture at birth.
      None has a bigger brain. None has a better brain. They only use theirs for
      more productive purposes than you do, that is why they are better than you
      are in class. If there is anyone in your class whose head is bigger than
      yours, it is not because the person possesses a bigger brain with extra
      ability; the difference is just in the water and blood content in his
      head. Everyone who outshines you in class has only been able to outshine
      you in the place of study first. They were first excellent readers before
      they became excellent students.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The people you look up to in class, will
      also, one day begin to look up to you, if you decide to exercise your
      brain and stretch it to the upper limit as they have done with theirs. The
      brain functions like an elastic rubber band. The more you stretch it, the
      larger it becomes, and the more things it can hold together. It works like
      the muscles. When a skinny man dedicates his time to faithfully going to
      the gym everyday, in less than a year, his muscular configuration changes;
      his biceps and triceps becomes bigger and you hardly can recognize him
      again.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">That is exactly how the brain works. If you
      can dedicatedly devote time to your study, those who have been looking
      down on you because of your poor academic performance before now will not
      identify you again when your results are released next semester. They will
      get to the result board and will be dazed with the kind of results that
      will be displayed in front of your name. Your G.P. would have been
      enlarged because of your devoted Personal Study Time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Majority of the lecturers, during
      examinations, want you to prove to them that you understand the topic
      under discussion. And you really need to understand it in order to prove
      to them that you really do. To really understand, you need to take time
      out and study it well enough. What you hear in class alone is not enough
      to give you a first class result, you need to research more and study the
      class notes more in other to perform excellently well in the examination.
      Most lecturers will teach you the principles of operation of the topic at
      hand, but they will</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">want you to discover all the applications of
      the principles by yourself, especially if they have given you one or two
      applications as class example.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Only powerful readers get powerful results.
      Check out your class and you will discover this: every outstanding student
      is an outstanding reader. To get the best result in a course, you have to
      give the best of your time to the course. To be at the top of the class
      when results are released, you have to be ahead of the class in what you
      study. It is that simple.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The theory has never changed and will
      probably never change till eternity: Study poorly, pass poorly. Study
      more, pass more. Study well, pass well.</p>
	  
	  
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>THE TWO FOR ONE RULE</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most students are not aware of this! In many
      higher institutions, the amount of lecture hours you take in a course per
      week determines the amount of credit units allocated to the course. A
      one-unit-course has one hour of lecture in a week, a two-unit-course is
      allocated two hours of lectures per week, a three-unit-course gets three
      hours, and for a four-unit-course, four hours, sometimes fragmented into
      two double periods, is assigned.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This, in essence, shows clearly that the
      amount of hours of personal studies you should devote to each course
      should be determined by the amount of lecture hours allocated to it. This
      will save you from investing so much time on the minor courses while the
      major courses suffer neglect.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The two for one rule is the basic
      requirement Personal Study Time for a full time student. It simply means
      that for every one hour of lecture period per course, you will need two
      hours of Personal Study Time per week.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This means that if you take lectures in a
      course just for one hour in a week, you must of necessity devote two hours
      of study time to the same course every week. If you take two hours of
      lectures per week in another course, either single periods at two
      different times in a week, or double period once in a week, you must be
      ready to commit about four hours of Personal Study Time to same course per
      week. The same goes for a three hour course and a four hour course per
      week; the former gets six hours and the latter gets eight hours of
      Personal Study Time per week.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Note that this will only help you to invest
      the minimum required time for personal study periods on each course. You
      will still have to adjust your personal time table to compensate for some
      very difficult courses, targeted grades, writing of lab reports, practical
      assignment and the likes. The rule of thumb is just the starting point.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>TYPES OF STUDY</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Having emphasized so much on studying, it is
      important here to note that not all kinds of personal study students
      engage in are profitable to them. Rather than help them progress in their
      academic pursuit, some of these study styles destroy their G.P. the more,
      since it is not done the way it is expected of them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Below are some of the study styles that will
      not help your personal study life maximally;</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1. IRRELEVANT STUDY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The first is Irrelevant Study. At their
      Personal Study Time, some students, for want of more information, decide
      to go to the library and consume just anything that is related to the
      topic under discussion and by so doing devour more facts than are actually
      necessary at this level of their life.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This done, rather than getting better for
      it, they become more confused, since they now know far much more than they
      are required to know at that level. Although no knowledge is loss, it is
      advisable to study only the things that are relevant to your level per
      time. Keep your intellectual excursions within the scope of what you need
      to know. This will save you the time and effort spent on reading
      irrelevant materials. You can even invest the spare time on reading other
      topics or courses rather than wasting it away on something you may not
      need till the next session.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is why the school always gives each
      student a faculty brochure that contains the description of each course
      you are offering in each semester, the course contents and also specifies
      the boundary of each topic in the course per semester. It is advisable to
      always check this brochure each semester so that you can know the course
      content, and also know when you begin to cross the boarder to the other
      side of what is expected of you as at now.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As a sign of mockery on campuses, students
      who constantly engage in irrelevant study are said to be over-syllabus
      readers. Or how else will you describe a year one student preparing for
      his examination with the textbook of a post-graduate year student!</p>
	  
	  
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2. FORCED STUDY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This type of study can also be called
      Mandated Study. This is the kind of study you engage in when you are
      compelled by a superior authority to go and study your books. It is not
      done willingly. It is not from your heart. You are forced to do it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Remember, back then in your secondary school
      days, when your parents notice that you have played too much all day, they
      ask you to go take your books and read. This sounds more like a form of
      punishment than a study session to you. I can imagine you never liked it
      then, since it was putting an end to the wonderful playtime you were
      having with your friends. This is an example of a forced study.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Also, in all boarding houses, each student
      is expected to observe a Personal Study Time that is called prep time. At
      such time, all the students in the hostel are mandated by the school
      authority and enforced by the senior students and school prefects to take
      their books to a secluded place and study. In this kind of study, it
      really does not matter whether you actually studied or not; or whether
      what you claim to study is understood or not, as long as your face is
      glued to your books, you have satisfied the interest of whoever wants you
      to study.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">More often than not, not much is always
      benefited from this kind of study. It is done with disgust for the work at
      hand and hatred for the one enforcing you to read, and not too much is
      gained thereafter, although time and energy is wasted. Only on very rare
      cases, where one actually shifts his focus from the one compelling him,
      and determines to engage in serious study at such moment, is the study
      benefitted from maximally.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">3 RUMOURED STUDY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Students are naturally lazy and do not
      always want to study except there is a need for it. Most times, the only
      time you see students who study a particular course move massively to the</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">library to go and read is when there is a
      rumor that the lecturer will give a class test at the next lecture period.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">At such times, you see students offering the
      course run helter skelter to update their notes, photocopy some materials,
      revise texts, go through their assignments, and do all sorts of things
      that they are supposed to have done before now. Most times, you really may
      not be able to trace the genesis of the rumor, it just starts like a
      smoke, spreads like a wildfire, and before you know it, the whole campus
      is trembling and shaking at the news of examination starting the following
      week.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the day, most times, they
      discover that it is only a rumor, and that there is actually no test or
      examination next week, and the students shut their books again and return
      back to their lackadaisical lifestyle until another test or examination is
      rumored. This kind of study is what I will call Rumored Study. It does not
      benefit anyone.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">4. IMPROMPTU STUDY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This kind of study is just like its
      predecessor. Students who have been living their life as though they will
      never need to read a page of their class note in order to pass the
      examination will just turn a new leave the instant the school releases the
      real end of semester examination time table.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In this case, it is no longer a rumor; it is
      confirmed by an official release from the school authority. You will find
      students incredibly going to the library, unusually working on past
      question papers and frantically looking for AOC (Areas of Concentration)
      as it is commonly called.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">When you see the level of seriousness of
      some students with their study at these times, you will be surprised that
      such individuals can really sit down and read. They stay awake all night
      and all day reading, trying to cover up for lost time by compressing all
      they have to cover into the little time available.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most schools release the examination time
      table about two weeks to the examination, so all that these kinds of
      students have to do their impromptu studies is just two weeks. This is not
      too benefiting as you can not successfully compress what you should have
      done in sixteen weeks into two weeks. Aside this, covering the required
      syllabus in two weeks does not really guarantee that you have fully
      understood what you have read. In the immediate, you may manage to pass
      the examination, but you can be sure you will certainly forget everything
      you read immediately after the examination (that is if you are lucky
      enough not to forget it either before the examination day or right in the
      examination hall). You only crammed it to pass, you really did not study.
      So, in the real sense of it, you cannot claim to know all that you have
      read.</p>
	  
	  
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5. MOTIVATED STUDY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is not very unusual to, once in a while,
      feel like not studying anything at a time you really need to study most.
      At such times, you need to be motivated by another student to study; the
      only factor that encourages you to go take your books and read is seeing
      other students reading and preparing for their examinations. This will
      spur you to start studying too.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There is nothing bad with it if this happens
      once in a while. But if it becomes the order of the day in your life, then
      there is a problem. If you can not take the initiative to take your books</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">and study on your own, and you are
      influenced only when you see other students or classmates studying, then
      you need to adjust.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">What if you find yourself in an environment
      where there is no one to motivate you? Does it mean you will never study?
      This kind of study is what I will call motivated or challenged study. It
      is not the best type of study.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">6 DECEPTIVE STUDY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This type of study is more of a pretense
      than a study. Those who engage in this are students who are supposed to be
      studying, and who are actually seen studying because their faces are
      buried in their books, but who are not truly studying. They only deceive
      others that they are studying.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This deception is done for reasons best
      known to them. They may just be looking at the pages of their books while
      listening to musicals from their phones, or just watching what is going on
      around them, while still pretending to be studying.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This kind of study, as we all know, is not
      good, as there is actually nothing to show for the numerous hours spent
      deceiving others that you are actually engaged in school work.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">7. UNNECCESSARY STUDY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most times when you see students who claim
      they are studying, you will be amazed at the kind of things they spend
      their time reading; materials that have nothing whatsoever to do with
      academics. It is commonplace to see students reading big novels, story
      books, and other junks when they have not read a page of their class
      notes.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">On the average, some students read up to
      four novels and countless number of magazines in a semester. They leave
      their textbooks, abandon their class notes, forsake seminar papers and all
      other journals that are needed to cause their GP to soar, and they
      intentionally read junks. This is not ideal.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As much as it is good to read other
      materials apart from your school work so as to have a broader knowledge
      and not streamline yourself to academic theories alone, it should not be
      done to the detriment of your school work. While the school is still in
      session, manage the limited time between the two, devoting more time to
      your academic work than the other. The school will soon go on break and
      you will have so much time during the holiday to read as many novels as
      you will like to read.</p>
	  
	  
    <p style="text-align: justify;">8. UNPLANNED STUDY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Satisfactory planning must precede every
      meaningful task. Hence, the common saying adequate preparation prevents
      poor performance. To get the best from your study session, it has to be
      prepared for. You will need to know in advance what course you are going
      to read at what time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most students do not do this. What they do
      is to gather different lecture of notes and textbooks together when it is
      time to study. Then they begin to choose arbitrarily, in no proper order,
      what to read next. This process wastes a lot of time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Preparing a time table on what to study in
      advance will make the mind unconsciously start to do a quiet review of
      what to study before then, and the whole system in your body will begin</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">to get prepared in advance to study that
      particular course. This makes your study session more advantageous.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Spread the courses you are studying through
      the days of the week such that you are able to cover all of your notes at
      least once every week, knowing what particular course to study on what
      particular day of the week. This way, you can get the best from each of
      your study session.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">9. DISRUPTIVE STUDY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This type of study is accompanied with
      constant and consistent disturbances and interruptions. The student is
      distracted from his study every now and then by other pressing factors. He
      really does not have a thirty minutes distraction-free period for his
      study.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The source of the distraction could be
      controllable or not, and the distractions themselves may be external or
      internal, it does not matter to him. He allows everything and anything to
      come in-between him and his study as many times as possible in every study
      session.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Every student must take care of every
      possible distraction before sitting down to read (Flip through Chapter 2
      of this book to remind yourself once again of ways to handle distractions)</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">10. PERAMBULATIVE STUDY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This happens when a student who is meant to
      be studying during his Personal Study Time does not make any meaningful
      progress again in a particular study session. He no longer assimilates
      anything in that session of study. In fact, the handwriting in his notes
      looks more to him like Greek than a language he is familiar with; he
      cannot make anything out of it. He reads and rereads a paragraph of few
      lines over and over again and does not still understand what it says.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is not necessarily an attack of the
      devil, it only means the brain is saturated at such times and needs a
      break. Postponing such study session to a later time is the most ideal
      thing to do at such moment.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">11. SELECTIVE STUDY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This happens when a student begins to play
      God by proving he knows all things at all times. He pretends he has the
      ability to determine what question comes out of the examination papers
      from the lecture notes. He decides which topics he wants to study in
      preparation for the exams and which he will not read simply because he
      claims to be sure that no question will come out of these topics. More
      often than not, they are always surprised when they get to the examination
      halls. Topics and chapters where they assumed that questions will out come
      out from are always the crux of the whole examinations.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>GETTING THE BEST FROM PERSONAL STUDY
        PERIOD</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1. Study Ahead Of Exams</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">One of the best ways to ensure you pass all
      your courses in school in flying colours is to start studying way ahead of
      the examinations. Do not wait until the end of the semester to commence
      your study. Immediately a new semester begins and the school releases the
      lecture time tables, start reading. It is a difficult thing to do but if
      you must come out excellently well, it is an important thing to do.
      Unconsciously it is registered in student’s mind that when the semester
      has just started, there is not so much work to do; this is not true. This
      is the time</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">you have to do most of your personal
      academic work because that is when you have to settle all that needs to be
      settled.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Excellent students begin their study the
      moment the lecture time tables are released, the non-excellent student
      wait until the examination time tables are released. Which will you rather
      be? Your personal study should start with the release of the lecture time
      table, not with the release of examination time tables. While other
      students still play around and wait for the release of the examination
      time table before commencing study, accumulating every lecture note until
      the end of the semester before seeing themselves as a full time student,
      the other student who had started studying at the release of the lecture
      time table has gone far in his study. This is one way to guarantee a good
      result. Start your personal study on time.</p>
	  
	  
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2. PREPARE IN ADVANCE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A sure way to get the best out of our
      personal study session is to avoid unplanned study. Unplanned study has
      been discussed above. Aside the school time table, every student must have
      a personal time table for his personal study period. Most students engage
      in arbitrary study. This is counterproductive. Always prepare ahead of
      each study session.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">3. SAME SPOT</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In order to encourage yourself, you should
      get yourself a permanent reading room if possible. If not, choose a corner
      in your room and place a comfortable reading table. Let this serve as your
      reading corner. You can also choose a particular section of the school
      library or general reading room. This helps your body system to easily
      adjust itself to receive and process intellectual facts once you are
      seated in such places; your body naturally concludes that you have resumed
      your study.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is the same reason why everyone in an
      office setting has his own separate office table and chair; in order to
      create an atmosphere of serious work once one takes his seat. If you can
      not afford the luxury of a reading room, separate a little corner in your
      room as your reading spot.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">4. BEST STUDY TIME</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Assimilation rates of individuals differ at
      various times of the day. Some people understands better when they study
      during the early hours of the day, say, between 5:00am to 7:00am, some
      when the sun is hot, some in the early evening, and some late evening.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This could be due to a number of factors,
      like personal upbringing, background, sensitivity to distractions when
      reading, and the likes. However, most students do not even have a clue as
      to what their best study time is. Each student must determine when best he
      assimilates so as to endeavor to plan more of his personal study period
      around such high-assimilation-period as they will achieve more with this.
      How to discover your best study time is discussed extensively in the next
      chapter.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5. FOCUS ON THE TASK AT HAND</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Teach your mind not to wander about. Focus
      on the task at hand per time. If you are able to eliminate all
      distractions before each of your study session, it may be quite easy for
      you to focus on what you are studying for a longer time than most of your
      mates who are still bothered with insignificant details that could have
      been handled before settling down to study.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">6. DO A DAILY REVIEW</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">One way to help yourself academically is to
      do a daily review of your notes. Before you go to bed each night, ensure
      that you go through whatever is done in class for that day. This type of
      daily review will help in a number of ways:</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(a) Since the lecture is still fresh in your
      mind, (it is not yet up to 24 hours), you will remember almost everything
      the lecturer said in class. Hence, you will need less time for the study.
      You will cover more in less time than if it is postponed to days later.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(b) It will also help you to reinforce
      whatever you have learnt for the day, so that it will not escape your
      memory quickly.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(c) It will save you from pilling together
      class notes, which you may not have time to cover if postponed till the
      examination period.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Can I study too much?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Yes! Keep in mind that while you should
      spend the appropriate amount of time studying, going overboard is
      counterproductive. Students often mistakenly think that if
      they spend an excessive amount of time studying just before exams, they
      will be better prepared. Long study sessions often become boring, and when
      your mind starts to wander around to other things during these sessions,
      this study time becomes wasted.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Learn how long you tend to concentrate on
      different subjects per time, so that you can schedule focused, effective
      study sessions. As time goes by, you may begin to increase the number of
      hours per day, as you find convenient and productive.</p>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">INVEST YOUR BEST IN THE BEST OF YOUR TIME</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Another major problem that most students
      have which impairs their G.P. critically is their inability to manage the
      time available to them. If asked, many students will confess that they do
      not have enough time at their disposal to do all that is compulsorily
      required of them. Other non-academic obligations are constantly competing
      for the time available for academic work. This continually gets them so
      overwhelmed and makes it increasingly difficult to give qualitative and
      valuable time to their primary pursuit on campus, which is their
      academics.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">For any student to manage the various
      responsibilities in his life, he will need to have a good grip on the
      usage of his time. If you are not able to successfully manage or regulate
      your time, you may eventually discover that the things that really matters
      in your life are denied the time they need to influence your destiny
      positively, at the expense of the things that really do not count in life.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The basic difference between the highly
      effective students and the others is in the way they manage their time.
      The highly effective students are in full control of their time while the
      others really do not know how to optimize their time to achieve their
      academic goals. This ability to manage their time aright has become a
      major habit of the highly efficient students which eventually helps them
      boost their G.P. This is what you are about to learn in this chapter,
      proper time management that will help your G.P. to ascend greater heights.
      Beyond increment in your G.P., the proper time management techniques you
      will learn in this chapter will help you to have good control over your
      time, and over your life.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Get this straight, you may have at your
      disposal all the time there is in the world, but if you do not use it
      wisely, it will not help you in any way to meet your goals, academic or
      otherwise. This is why you need to learn how to manage well the time
      available to you. The essence of learning time management as a student is
      to help you know how to spend your time doing the things you really need
      to do in order to achieve your desired academic goals, and ultimately to
      add value to your life.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Either as a full time or part time student,
      if you are not very concerned about how to marry your schedule with your
      available time, you can easily become overwhelmed by all there is to do.
      There will always be more to do than you have time for. This is why most
      students always complain they do not have enough time to do the things
      they really need to do in school; they silently wish they have more than
      24 hours in a day so as to accommodate more.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A number of the activities that consumes the
      most part of students’ time, aside the normal lecture periods, will have
      nothing to do with their school work. The way out for most of them is the
      need to set their priorities right, cutting down on some of the activities
      they really desire to be part of, so that they can have enough time for
      the others. However, absurd as it may sound, for so many of the students,
      once they discover they need more time for some other events, the only
      activity they cut-down is their personal study hours, which is the main
      essence of their being in school.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Unknown to so many of the students, if they
      properly analyze their usage of time, they will discover that, for every
      student, there is about two to four hours that is lost during the day.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Let us call this time the Unused Time. This
      block of time is different from time that is intentionally wasted. Time
      spent in engaging in unproductive and unreasonable activities on campus
      can though be called Wasted Time, but it is still accounted for at the end
      of the day, since you know exactly what you did with it, just that it was
      wasted. But aside this Wasted Time, some accumulated number of minutes,
      which can run into several hours at the close of the day, are lost at
      different times of the day, and cannot really be accounted for at the end
      of the day. This time is what, in this book, is referred to as Unused
      Time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This lost time is best invested engaging in
      profitable tasks. By consciously bringing your attention to this block of
      time on daily basis, you will discover that, no matter how busy your day
      is, there is enough time for personal study. If you have forgotten what
      you read about Personal Study Time, you may flip back to chapter 3 for a
      quick reminder.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">To calculate how much of this Unused Time
      you have available at your disposal, think about everything you do in a
      day, and write them down in a list, including all schedules like time for
      preparation of meals, dining, bathing, dressing up, siesta, recreation,
      travel time, family time, work etc.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Draw a 24 hour time table (there is one at
      the end of this chapter, you can make more duplicates from it) and fix in
      all the things you intend to engage in for each hour of the day. Do this
      ahead of time. Take the list along with you everywhere you go for that
      day, and carefully mark the things you actually engaged in, noting the
      hours that are spent doing practically nothing. These hours spent doing
      nothing (either productive or not) practically are your Unused Time. For
      some who are very meticulous with their time, it may not be more than one
      to two hours. But for others who are carefree, it may run into four to
      five hours per day.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The total time available to you as a student
      is:</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Total Time Available = Productive Time +
      Wasted Time + Unused Time</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Where,</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Wasted Time = Unproductive Time. This is
      time spent engaging in things that contributes nothing to either your
      today or your tomorrow.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Unused Time is time spent in doing
      practically nothing. Whatever is done at such time, if any at all, can
      neither be remembered nor be accounted for.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The actual amount of time you have for
      personal study will be the addition of your Wasted Time and Unused Time</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Available Personal Study Time = Wasted Time
      + Unused Time</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Your goal as a student therefore, in
      learning these time management skills, is to gain control over your time,
      rather than let it control your life, by making sure that both your Wasted
      Time and your Unused Time are rechannelled into your Available Time for
      more productive usage: this, is the whole essence of living. It is about
      taking the ownership of your time by yourself to your own advantage. You
      become a master of your time, rather than its enslaved prisoner.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If asked, many students will admit that they
      spend most of their time on campus on academic related activities, and
      still wonder why they fail some of their courses after such efforts. But
      the truth is that, they really do not spend as much time as they claim
      they spend on their academics, and worse still, they are not aware of this
      fact. If they are very observant, they will easily discover that a huge
      chunk of their day gets swallowed up by other commitments outside their
      academic work. They just get deceived into thinking they actually study
      because they do not have a well-planned manageable study time. They just
      read whenever they feel like, so as to satisfy their conscience that they
      have study.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The only way to rightly monitor how many
      hours of your campus time is genuinely devoted to academic related
      activities is through a personal time management schedule. With this, you
      will have a definite knowledge of where your time goes. This will help you
      create a clear picture of what your day, week, month, and if possible,
      your whole semester will look like, so that you can easily re-invest your
      time into other things, in case you discover it is going the way you do
      not like.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Time can be your friend, and it can also be
      your enemy, both depending on what you do with it. Learning a good time
      management skill can help you to get the most out of life. You get more
      done with less effort and minimal stress. This will not only help you as a
      student today, it will count for eternity. The time management skills and
      disciplines you develop today as a student can help you for the rest of
      your life. So, you are not wasting your time learning this. It is really
      important.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In the immediate, how you manage your time
      will eventually determine your final academic success; every student
      around the world will learn this sooner or later. One major habit of an
      effective student is his ability to manage every student's most critical
      resource: time. Of a truth, the most successful students academically are
      hardly the smartest of them all, but those who have a very firm grip on
      what they do with their time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Admissions to higher institutions have
      become so highly competitive today, especially in this part of the world.
      If you are lucky enough to get one, you are holding a highly coveted spot,
      and should do all in your power to make sure that you make the best use of
      it to your advantage. After all the efforts made to get this admission,
      the way you manage your time while on campus will be the real proof that
      shows whether you deserve the admission or not.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>MANAGING YOUR TIME</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In order to structure a time management
      technique that will serve you best, you will need to first prepare for it.
      Time management is not just about drawing lines and tables on a blank
      sheet of paper and randomly fixing different events at different time
      slots. You need to really prepare for what you want to do so as to get the
      best out of it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">To start off, you must ascertain what tops
      your priority scale as a student. What is most important to you at this
      stage of your life; friends, families, a pet project, career, sports,
      politics, social networks, or a good grade? On the list, rank them in
      order of 1 to 5, 5 being the highest. This list will help you know what
      item you value most, and which should take the hugest and the least of
      your time per day. With this, you will be able to allocate a realistic
      amount of time to each of the things that matters most in your life,
      without allocating too much time to the minor while the major suffers.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Knowing what is important to you is very
      crucial in time planning because effective time management is all about
      creating enough time space in your day to have enough time to achieve your
      goals, be it academic or otherwise. The fact that everyone is in school
      does not actually mean every one really desire to graduate from school
      with a first class degree in their academics. The student who wants to
      graduate with the best academic performance in his faculty will definitely
      have a different study-time schedule to another who wants to become a
      hip-hop celebrity or a football star before graduation. So, know what is
      important to you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Secondly, after identifying what your goals
      are, also identify what needs to be done in order to achieve them. If your
      priority in school is academics, (one may be deceived to think every
      student’s priority is their academics, in the reality, it is not true),
      your goal may be to move from the present academic level you are to a
      higher academic level, either from a third class to a second class lower,
      or from a second class lower to a second class upper, or from a second
      class upper to a first class.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Thirdly, identify what you need to do to
      achieve these goals. How many hours of study per day, per week, and per
      month do you need? How many of these study hours will be for specific
      courses? These need to be concluded before you start with your first
      productive personal time table.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most Preferable Study Time</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Organize your Personal Study Time to
      coincide with the times of day when you are most awake and alert so that
      you can make the best use of it. Which period of the day do you work best?
      For some students, they work best in the early mornings, for some, they
      fare better at broad day light, for some, in the evenings, and for some
      others, very late at night. You will need to ascertain which period of the
      day works best for you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Different system works for different people.
      To know what works best for you, study different portions of the same
      textbook or lecture notebooks at different times of the day and take note
      of which period you enjoyed most. At such periods, you will cover more in
      the least available time because your rate of assimilation will be very
      high.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This, we will call your Peak Study Period
      (PSP) and should be your most preferable study time. You may repeat the
      exercise more than once so as to genuinely ascertain that you are not
      making a mistake on your Peak Study Period. Your Peak Study Period is that
      time during the day which you assimilate more than any other periods of
      the day. You seem to be more effective and more productive academically at
      such hours. If invested in your study, you will be able to cover more
      grounds in little time and with better understanding of things read.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">For some, it may be during the early hours
      of the day, say between 4am to 6am. For some it may be just before lecture
      hours, say 6am to 7:50am. For others, it could be in the evening, and for
      some others, late at night. However, it is not advisable to choose the
      dead hours of the night as your normal Peak Study Periods because this may
      tamper with your sleep and cause you discomforts later on.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Once you discover your Personal Peak Period,
      most of your Personal Study Time should be designed to fall in line with
      it, especially sessions for the most difficult courses. All other
      activities you may have to do for the day should be moved to other areas
      of the day so as to allow you ample time of study at such study sessions.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It will do you a lot of good if you
      communicate your Peak Study Periods to others, especially intimate friends
      who may have legitimate (but not too urgent) reasons to disturb you at
      such periods. Let them know that you will not be available for any
      socialization at such time because you want to invest that period in your
      study. If they are indeed your good friends, and they want the best for
      you, they will respect your opinion. You do not have to feel bad about
      this; denying your friends just two hours out of the 24 hours in a day,
      for the sole purpose of investing it in the betterment of your own life is
      one of the best things you can do to yourself.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If phone calls are proving to be a
      distraction at such periods, put your cell phone on silence, and place it
      far away from your reach, such that you will not even know if it rings.
      Better still, switch it off completely. This will help you concentrate
      fully on the task at hand, especially at this time that your brain is
      ready to assimilate at maximum speed. No part of this session should be
      wasted.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>HOW TO MANAGE YOUR TIME</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1. DO IT INTENTIONALLY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Allocate time every day to plan your daily
      activities in advance. This is called Forward Planning. Remember the
      popular niche: every student who fails to plan is planning to fail. So,
      plan your day in advance. Take out some time every day, say, 5minutes
      every morning or every night to plan for the new day. Make planning your
      day an important part of your daily routine, and you will not regret what
      it makes out of your day.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2. APPOINTMENT CALENDAR</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">An appointment calendar will help you to
      combine together in one place all the major appointments you need to keep
      in a whole semester. It will contain all the important non-academic
      meetings you are obliged to attend, either in or out of the campus
      environment, like social gatherings (e.g. a family wedding, an uncle’s
      naming, relative’s burial, a friend’s birthday party, a classmate’s bash,
      a ball, matriculation, convocation etc), spiritual meetings (e.g.
      fellowship activities, church departmental meetings and the likes) or
      family meetings. Allot time for planned recreation, sports, club
      activities, etc. Include routines, errands, and study time. Leave some
      free time for yourself so you have flexibility.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">All your scheduled events will be included
      in this appointment calendar. To have all of these in one place, most
      importantly on one calendar, will help you to plan your time for months
      ahead. It will serve as your long term “to do list”, especially for
      non-academic events.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Always remember to include the time needed
      for social gatherings. An average student does not include time for
      socializing in his time schedule. Man is a social being who always need to
      enjoy a good social life in order to balance up the sum total of his
      activities. So, do not only limit your scheduled events or your
      appointments only to academic activities. Make it a balanced schedule;
      include all the time needed for socialization. Enter important dates for
      your social and family life. Most times, in the actual fact, the time for
      socializing even takes more time than is invested in the real academic
      work, if one is not careful. So, to guard against this, plan ahead for it!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, ensure your new time management
      schedule reflects your priority. Enough had been discussed already on
      this.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">3. SCHEDULE YOUR EVENTS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">One major skill that will help you as a
      student is the ability to plan ahead of every program and events you
      intend to be a part of. Determine what time the event needs to be done,
      and how long it would take. Most students do the first without bothering
      to do the second, so they end up spending so much time, much more than
      necessary.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not just try to schedule the timing of
      your events alone, always add the duration, and make every effort as much
      as possible to keep to both. If you need to do a task for someone, always
      determine the duration of the task before ever agreeing to do it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">4. TO DO LIST</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">One good way to help yourself is to
      self-motivate, since nobody will be there to remind you to go do your
      homework or to go take your books and read. However, it can often be
      difficult to self-motivate. So a good strategy may be to make up a
      comprehensive list of things you want done during the day, allocating
      specific time slots to things that necessarily must be done, and when to
      do them. Such list is called a ‘To Do’ list.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Your to do list is your monthly appointment
      calendar broken into a daily or weekly format. It contains the precise
      things to do that day or that week, as earlier written in your appointment
      calendar weeks before. For a student, it is more productive if it is done
      daily, rather than a weekly list. It saves from procrastination.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Have a daily to do list that highlights all
      the things you unavoidably must do for that particular day of the week.
      This will include all the lectures you have for the day, your personal
      study sessions, and other extracurricular activities. The list should be
      arranged in the order of their importance and attended to in the same
      order. It should be the first thing you do in the morning, that is, if it
      is not done the night before.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5. START AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike other students who do not really see
      the need to start active personal study at the beginning of the semester
      because they always feel that serious academic work has not yet commenced,
      and so they play away until mid-semester, or towards the end of the
      semester when the examinations are close by before they start to study,
      you should start as early as possible.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Such students have lost over half of their
      productive study time playing. Starting to study early enough will do you
      a whole lot of goods:</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(i) It will help you to move ahead of the
      class. You will cover more grounds than your mates who are just waiting
      for the lecturer to come teach them in class.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(ii) It will help you understand whatever
      your lecturer teaches better than those who have not had any contact with
      the topics before.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(iii) It will help you perform excellently
      in unscheduled test. Whenever the test is announced in class, you are not
      fidgety like other unserious students; you are ready for it because you
      have prepared for it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(iv) It will ultimately save you the last
      minute rush when the exams comes knocking.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(v) It will help boost your G.P.
      effortlessly.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">6. FIRST THINGS FIRST</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do the first things first. Postpone all
      unnecessary activities until your work is done. Unnecessary activities in
      this regard will refer to activities that provisions have not been</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">made for in your schedule for the day. Most
      times, you will discover that they are routines or tasks that can be put
      off until your major task is accomplished.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Before rushing to the cinemas with a bag of
      plantain chips and a cold bottle of drink to watch a movie at the weekend
      with your friends, make sure you have taken care of everything you need
      to. First things first! Do not let things pile up. Stay up-to-date on
      assignments to help avoid overload.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This may be a little bit challenging to you
      as a student, but overtime, you will master the act. This is because, from
      time to time, opportunities come your way that looks so enticing and
      appalling, but have not been scheduled in your time frame. So, once in a
      while when it becomes very necessary, you may need to rearrange your
      schedule, so as to admit very present needs. The schedule is not meant to
      manage you, you are meant to manage it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You only need maturity to discern which of
      these opportunities we need to be flexible with and accommodate in our
      carefully planned schedule, and which one we need to reschedule, as it
      will only distract us from meeting up with our schedule activities,
      without commensurate positive impact either on our academics or on our
      lives.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">7. SIMPLIFY COMPLEX ACTIVITIES</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There are times you have complex
      assignments, research works, and reports of practical sessions or huge
      term papers that may require days or weeks to be done. These always look
      like a big task to students, especially when they have about a month
      before the submission date. Most students do nothing about it until the
      day of submission before they begin to rush to get it done and eventually
      do not put their best into it because of the shortage of time. Aside these
      academic works, some other domestic activities look so complicated that so
      many students abandon it until it is almost too late.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In order to achieve success in activities
      like this, such big tasks can be simplified by breaking them into smaller
      tasks that may be easier to achieve in quick successions. Spread each
      segment over a period of time. This will give you enough time to do a
      brilliant work without being under any duress of time or otherwise.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Breaking the assignment into manageable
      portions will ensure that its complexity does not overwhelm you or wear
      you out. Allocate time units at different days to each portion, making it
      as flexible as possible. This will save you from spending unreasonable
      amount of time on it at once at the expense of the other things you need
      to do.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Always avoid the last minute rush; never put
      anything worthwhile off until the last minute. It is grossly irresponsible
      of any student to always wait till the last minute when it is almost late
      to complete his homework. It does not speak well of you as an effective
      student.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you need help in getting the task done,
      know precisely who to go to for help early enough whenever the help is
      needed. Putting things off to the last minute can be very stressful, and
      you may even encounter difficulties over some complex long term projects.
      At such close range, if you discover you need help, you hardly get one.
      This is why such last minute crisis can be very disastrous.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">8. DO NOT POSTPONE SMALL TASKS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to students, procrastination
      does not only affect the big things. Even for the small tasks, it is
      always tempting for most to avoid assignments until just before its due
      date. These small tasks most times look so small that students always
      conclude they can be done at any given time in a rush, and so always
      postpone them till a later or more convenient time. This is not proper as
      it leaves you with little or no time to understand the totality of the
      subject or discuss the problems with colleagues in your tutorial group.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You may put yourself under unnecessary
      pressure, undergo stress, and your health and other commitments can suffer
      as a result of this. This is because, once not done when it should be
      done, these small tasks end up becoming like bigger tasks and they eat
      into time allotted to other bigger events. This is a great lesson for all
      students; once scheduled, no small task should be postponed to a later
      time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">9. ACTIVITY COMBINATION</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A whole lot can be achieved if students will
      maximize the numerous brief moments they have on daily basis in between
      their major activities. Some activities can cohabit together without one
      disturbing the other. So many small things can be done in between large
      events, and these small events, if added together, can amount to a large
      chunk of time. When you schedule your activities, determine such
      activities that can be done together, it saves you a lot of time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">For example, you may iron your clothes while
      watching a movie, or copy some class notes while waiting for your noodles
      to boil. You may decide to reply your emails while taking a bus ride; do a
      quiet review of the last topic the lecturer taught in your mind while
      taking a walk to the cafeteria, or write the introductory paragraph to
      your essay while waiting in the reception to see your course adviser.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Intentionally look for activities that can
      go together, without one affecting the other; it will definitely save you
      some precious time. Little moments like these can be maximized to your
      advantage. Use these spare minutes wisely and you will successfully kill
      two birds with one stone.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">10. MARKED FILE FOLDERS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As a full time student, you will have a lot
      of sheets and pieces of papers around you. Some of these sheets, as rough
      as they will look, contain vital information that may be advantageous to
      you in the immediate future. The tendency will always be to throw these
      papers arbitrarily in any bag around, or on a table which is already
      filled with similar materials. This makes it quite difficult to retrieve
      them with ease at the point when such is urgently needed.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Aside the difficulty in its retrieval, going
      through the whole pile of papers and sorting out so many irrelevant sheets
      each time you urgently need just one of them consumes so much of your
      time. To avoid this silent waste of time, the use of marked folders will
      help you to avoid the time squandered on constantly looking for materials
      needed for study. Always file related pieces of papers that are still
      useful in a marked folder that differentiates it from others.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">These useful, correlated and relevant
      materials are kept in a particular marked folder, with a group name
      written on the folder and all the folders kept neatly in a corner or on
      your reading table. Each time one of the materials is needed, you only go
      straight to the folder that has its group name to extract it from the
      file. This saves you a whole lot of time cumulatively.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The next question in the mind of any lazy
      student will be, “Where do I get that much money to invest in these
      folders since my pocket money cannot accommodate such extra expenses?”
      This is nothing to fret about. If you cannot afford it, you do not have to
      spend a fortune in getting such folders. Sachets of old big envelopes may
      be converted into such files. Old calendars too may serve as a file jacket
      if folded into two.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">11. REVIEW YOUR DAY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you are just starting this, and are not
      used to effectively managing your time intentionally before, it may be a
      little difficult keeping to your allocated time. Changes do not come easy
      you know. You may have to do a little daily exercise to help you adapt to
      it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">At the close of each day, you will have to
      do a review of your activities during the day to see how well you have
      been able to manage your time for that day.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Which activities took more time than is
      needed?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Which needs more time than is allocated?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Which should be moved from where it is to a
      more convenient time?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Which is a major distraction to your
      academics generally, and what can be done about it?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Which is a disturbance to your personal
      study time and how can you control it?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Reviewing your day in such a way as this
      will also reveal to you your Wasted Time, Unused Time, and Productive
      Time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You may also want to review your week.
      Examine how you have spent your whole week. If you are excited at the way
      you have managed your time, reward yourself with something special, like a
      lunch at an eatery, or an extra meat on your plate, a cone of ice cream, a
      day out with a friend, or whatever.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">12. The “Time Waters</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">After reviewing your day, if you discover
      avenues through which your time gets wasted, attend to them immediately.
      If you strongly feel they are things that you cannot completely do away
      with, set a time limit on them. Such things are called "Time Wasters".</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">These “time wasters” may come through
      avenues like spending too much time on internet surfing, replying social
      media friends, watching home videos, or whatever. Set the time limit and
      stick to it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">For example, you may decide not to watch
      more than two home videos in a week, and that is after you are sure you
      have completed all pending academic works and assignments. You may decide
      not to spend more than 5 minutes in every hour on social media. Rather
      than attending to every ping and alert as soon as your phone beeps, you
      save all for the last 5 minutes in the hour, attend to the ones you can
      attend to in that time period, and save the remaining till the next hour’s
      5 minute social media session. This will save you a lot of time and keep
      you more productive.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>ENEMIES OF TIME MANAGEMENT</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As much as you try to manage your time, you
      will still find it difficult to do so as you desire. However, no matter
      how difficult it seems, it is not impossible. You only need to be more
      disciplined so as to ensure that you attain your goal of being in complete
      control of your time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the factors that will militate
      against your success in time management are discussed below.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1. Short-Term Gratification</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">One major enemy of time management for most
      students, especially those who are teens and youths, is short term
      gratification. The quest for short-term satisfaction may begin to dictate
      to you what should be considered important, at the expense of what you
      truly believe to be important. This obsession for immediate pleasure will
      only mislead you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you have carefully taken the pain to plan
      your time in advance, follow the plan. Except on very rare cases where
      there are emergencies, or where you have a free time-slot to toy with your
      schedule, do not let anything disrupt your carefully laid out plan,
      especially something which may not have any serious positive impact on
      your academic goal or your health.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most short term pleasures that look very
      essential today are relatively very unimportant when you view them from a
      future perspective. Some other things that appear to be relatively
      unimportant today might be very important when you view them from the same
      angle So, ask yourself, which one has more relevance in the future, this
      short term gratification, or what you are about to sacrifice for it? A
      wise answer will reveal to you what to do!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Your academic years, though very short,
      represents a period of time in your life that may have a major impact on
      how the rest of your life will eventually turn out. Your ultimate success
      in the future will depend on what concrete actions you take today. If you
      keep this in mind, it will ensure that the daily decisions you make are
      wise ones.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2. Peer Pressure</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Another strong enemy of time management is
      peer pressure. Most students do not have a mind of their own. They only
      move with the crowd. They cannot decide to stand alone; they easily blend
      in. Even when they really do not support whatever is being done, they find
      it difficult to stand out; it is easier for them to flow with the crowd.
      Do not fall into this category. Learn to think for yourself.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t let peer pressure make you do things
      you have not planned in your to do list for the day. Everybody may be
      doing it, but you know what is best for you. And what is best for you is
      what you have planned on your time schedule.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Aside that, your personal goals may be
      different from that of others; of what use then is following others, whose
      goals are at logger heads with yours? Focus on the goals you have set for
      yourself and follow up on your top priorities. Align your daily activities
      with your long-term values and let it reflect in every of your actions.
      Bear in mind that every seemingly insignificant action you take today is
      planting the seeds for your long-term success or failure tomorrow.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">3. Procrastination</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Procrastination can lead to increased
      anxiety. Always decide what needs to be done today, what can be put off
      till tomorrow, and what someone else can do on your behalf. What needs to
      be done today, must of necessity, be done today; no postponement. Things
      that can be put off till some other day should not necessarily be stuffed
      into the day, especially if they are really not that important to be done
      that day; they can be allocated time on other days.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Cramming too many events and activities into
      24hours than is humanly achievable will encourage you to keep postponing
      things that needs be done. If need be, the ones that can be delegated
      should be attended to accordingly. This will give you ample time to attend
      to the ones that are very important and at the same time very urgent.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">An activity may be important but not urgent,
      this can be postponed. Some may be urgent and not important, these you can
      delegate. But there are some that are both important and urgent. These
      ones must be done as at the time expected of you, and not be
      procrastinated.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">4. Inability To Say ‘No’</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The ability to say ‘No’ is a very crucial
      one in time management. A lot of time is lost because so many students do
      not know how to say ‘no’ when assistance is required of them that will
      ultimately impact on their carefully arranged time structures.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Every time someone asks you to do something
      for him, see it in terms of taking away from you one or some of the 24
      golden gifts that heaven has bestowed on you for the day. Before accepting
      the offer, ascertain how much time it will take you to accomplish this
      assignment that is required of you. Then check your time schedule for the
      day, and see if you really have any unused block of time that can be
      allocated for the assignment on the said day. If there is, you may be
      willing to accept. If there is none, you may check on other days where
      your time belt will allow you accommodate the assignment and confirm if
      that will be okay with the person requiring the favor of you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Always remember that sometimes what is
      important to someone else at a particular time may not necessarily be as
      important to you at that moment; so, you may have to occasionally say ‘no’
      in order to stay on track with your own personal schedules. Convince
      yourself that the tasks on your schedule and the resulting stress are as
      important to you as other people's needs are to them, if not more.
      Therefore set guiding principles that will control the interruption of
      your time by others or the rescheduling of your work time to accommodate
      others. A major one of such principle is the ability to say ‘no’.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This type of lifestyle will help you manage
      your time judiciously as a student. Sad to say, you may feel uncomfortable
      when you are forced to say ‘no’ to someone very close to you, but you
      would have given yourself the joy that can only be derived from meeting
      your set goals. Such person may even learn to respect you the more,
      knowing fully well that you are in complete control of your time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Another angle to it is saying ‘yes’ to
      something that is not too important to your goals simply because the date
      is still very far away. The date may seem so far today, but it will
      definitely get closer someday, and more so, the same effort will be
      needed, whether the appointment is tomorrow or next year. So, if it is
      unimportant, let it remain unimportant, and save yourself the time for
      more important things.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>LAST ADVICE; KEEP TO IT</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Developing a good time management skill may
      be a journey that may begin with the things you have read in this book,
      but you will need constant practice and other guidance along the way. So,
      start today.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">To start this may look difficult and
      cumbersome, but roughly draft your idea and get going! You
      will have time to edit and develop later. Do not forget the Chinese
      proverb that says ‘a</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">journey of a mile starts with the first
      step’. Be willing to take the first step that will finally put your life
      in a better shape and put you in full control of your time. </p>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">NETWORK WITH BETTER BRAINS</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The higher institution experience may
      largely be about academics, but networking with other brilliant students
      is one of the most important virtues a student can engage in to ensure
      great success in his academics.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Networking with better brains on campus can
      be defined as the concept of building a mutual relationship with selected
      students in your class or department who are a lot better off than you are
      academically, for the sole purpose of helping and encouraging one another
      to have a better academic standing today, and a great future tomorrow.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">One thing any student who wants to succeed
      cannot do without is to network with others. The moment you get to a point
      in your academic pursuit where you think you need no other person in your
      school to succeed academically, then you have missed it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">No man is an island of wisdom. Everyone will
      always need someone to get somewhere, especially when it comes to passing
      examinations. You cannot triumph single-handedly; you need others. There
      is something you know which you need to let someone else know; as much as
      there is something someone else knows which you also need to learn from
      him because it will seriously benefit your academic life.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is one thing that is very common among
      the best students in each class but which is rare among the average
      students. The best student in a particular course knows his limits and
      limitations in other subjects. He knows his strengths and weaknesses. He
      knows other students who are better off than him in other courses and he
      knows when he needs to run to them for clarity (either publicly or
      privately) if he has problems with such courses. He does not deceive
      himself that since he is the best student in a particular course, he
      should be able to handle any other problem in all of the other courses
      without any assistance. He always watches out for other students who are
      better than him to relate with. This may not be too obvious to you, but it
      is the sincere truth: the best students in your class know where they meet
      outside the class in order to share knowledge. If they have not started
      meeting with you, you are not one of them!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This experience is different with the
      average students; they live a more academically confined life. Rather than
      looking for better brains to relate with, they bring themselves together
      in clusters and relate together. Ever heard the adage “in the land of the
      blind, the one eyed man is the king”? This is exactly what happens in
      their midst. They are birds of the same feathers, so they flock together.
      They may have one or two students among them who</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">are fairly better than the rest, but they
      really do not have any who is exceptionally good and outstanding in their
      bunch.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>THE CHALLENGE OF NETWORKING</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">One cannot really say why this is so. It
      could be attributed to a number of factors, like; fear of insult and
      embarrassment from colleagues, inferiority complex, poor human relations
      skill, or whatever?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">One may want to presume that one major
      challenge students have that does not encourage them to network with
      others is their poor interpersonal relationship. Students nowadays are so
      device-dependent that even in a class full of other students, they find it
      difficult to relate or feel at home with one another. They feel more
      comfortable texting or chatting with someone miles away from them while
      neglecting those who are in their immediate environment. This is not too
      encouraging. Every student needs to develop a very strong interpersonal
      relationship with fellow students in his immediate environment.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you are among the average students in
      your class, you can change the course of your academic performance today
      by deciding to stand on the shoulders of those who are better off than you
      so that you can see farther and clearer in your academic pursuit. This is
      what is called networking.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Naturally, an average student will prefer to
      live his life amidst the flock of others whom he is a lot better than
      academically, or those who are just a bit better off than him, so that he
      can boast of his prowess among them, but a highly effective student,
      driven by a desire to boost his G.P. will be on the lookout for those who
      are far better off than him, or even the best student in his class, and
      will do all possible to become his friend so that he also can gain from
      them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is never too early to start networking,
      but it can be too late, if done when situations no longer permits it. Most
      students will only think of networking when they get stranded in the
      examination hall. Then, they organize themselves to form a structural bond
      with the most brilliant student that sits closest to them in the
      examination hall, all in a bid to siphon answers to unknown questions from
      them. At this stage, networking with better brains is a criminal offence.
      When caught by the examination supervisor, the school authority always
      disciplines such seriously.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The real concept of networking for a student
      starts from the first day of lecture, and not in the examination hall. The
      idea is to dig your well before you are thirsty; something like planting
      the seed before the day of harvest comes. Once you get into the
      examination hall, it is already too late to build any meaningful
      connections legally.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">One advantage of growing beneficial
      relationships before the examination pressure mounts is that it gives both
      parties the required time that is needed to help one another. The ‘helper’
      is not under any pressure himself, and rather than just tell you what the
      answers to the questions are, he takes his time to explain to you why that
      is the answer.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>BENEFITS OF NETWORKING</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In networking with students in your class,
      you must prepare for the worse. You may not always receive the kind of
      hospitality and welcome which you think you deserve from the</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">other colleague. You may be avoided
      cunningly. You may be disrespected initially. You may even face outright
      rejection.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The issue is, you are the one who needs help
      here, and it may require some level of humility and persistence on your
      part before you can receive it. If you go in your pride, you may get
      nothing worthwhile in return, that is if you are not embarrassed.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Many students do not realize the importance
      of networking as a student. Some of them are discussed below:</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1. CREATES FUTURE SUCCESS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Academic network is an important part of
      creating a bigger future success. Everyone you see on your campus today
      may all be called students, but in few years’ time, all will not be at the
      same level of achievements. Some would definitely have gone far ahead of
      others.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine if the best student in your class
      whom you refuse to network with today now become the CEO of a
      multinational group, and you need his endorsement on a proposal? It may
      take you some time trying to introduce yourself as a former colleague. The
      networks you are building today are not just for today, they will last
      longer into the future. The primary aim today may be defined within the
      confines of academic achievements, but it may grow into a world of
      possibilities tomorrow.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">So, do not be carried away by your
      ‘e-friends’ (the friends you have on facebook, twitter, 2go, Whatsapp,
      Wechat, Badoo, BBm, and the other social media networks), spend more
      qualitative time with real personalities around you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2. OPPORTUNITY OF A SECOND CHANCE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Networking will give you more than one
      chance to listen to the lecture again and again. Most times when the
      lecturer teaches in class and you do not understand the topics fully, you
      may ask him to explain again once or twice, after which you look stupid to
      the whole class if you still claim not to understand.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">At this stage most students just keep quiet
      and pretend to have understood. They then return home to start battling
      with the topic on their own. Examination performance in such course is not
      always encouraging. If you have built a network with a better brain in
      your class, even if you do not understand what the lecturer says in class,
      your friend can go over it for as many times as it takes you to
      understand. This saves you the embarrassment of being seen as a stupid
      fellow in class because you are always drawing the class backward.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">3. EASY LEARNING</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Another advantage of networking is that
      students help each other to learn in an easier way. Students learn better
      when taught by other students than when taught by a lecturer.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is why group discussions at times, is
      more effective and produces better results, especially when done after the
      lecture. They assist each other through shared explanations, general
      discussions, cooperate learning, encouragements and educational support.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">4. BETTER ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">One of the best advantages of networking is
      that it helps you to become better academically. After listening to the
      lecturer in class, and hearing again from your study - friend, coupled</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">with your academic investments during your
      Personal Study Time, you really will understand the course better than
      most students in your class who have only heard it once from the lecturer.
      This will be reflected in your result at the end of the semester.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It encourages overlearning. Hearing over and
      over again what you have heard before in class will help enforce whatever
      is being taught in the mind of the students. It serves as a way of
      revision for students.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some difficult and demanding courses may not
      easily be understood when read alone at personal study hours. The presence
      of someone who knows it better can save one from making serious mistakes
      in technicalities or calculations as well as from wastage of time and
      resources.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5. SKILL ACQUISITION</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Networking is very essential in today's
      competitive market. Interacting with others while as a student serves as a
      way of learning one of the indispensable skills needed for survival in the
      labor market today - interpersonal skill. You learn to relate with people
      from different culture and background, which helps you later on in future
      to cope with anyone from anywhere.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>HOW TO NETWORK FOR BETTER ACADEMIC RESULT</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Appropriate networking among students can be
      done in three different ways.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A. ONE ON ONE TUTORING</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is about the most common form of
      students’ network. A student who has obvious academic needs and who
      desires to overcome this academic challenges intentionally source for
      other better students around who can help him overcome these challenges.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In order to get the best from this type of
      network, you need to be careful to do it the right way.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">How To Get The Best From One-On-One Tutoring</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1. Categorize Your Courses</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The first thing you will need to do is to
      classify the courses you are taking this semester into two groups. The
      first group will be the ones you feel are easy to understand and you
      necessarily may not need any special assistance to scale through.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The second group will be those which you
      honestly know within yourself that if you depend solely on what the
      lecturer teaches in the classroom, you likely will fail in the examination
      hall. The second group is where you really need help.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2. Suggest Possible Aids</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Having streamlined the courses, which now
      has enabled you to know precisely where help is needed, the next thing to
      do is to suggest at least two persons around who can help you in each of
      the courses. You may consider a course-mate who is offering the same
      course but who obviously knows more than you do in the course, an old
      friend who had taken the course before and who is good at it, or a senior
      colleague who was taught by the same lecturer in that department and who
      performed quite well in his examination. Any of these ones can be a
      possible source of help for you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">3. Contact Your Aid</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Out of the possible aid options you have for
      each course, pick on the most approachable person or the most likely
      person to accept your proposals and contact him. Such contact should not
      be done through phone call, text messages or social media. Physical
      contact is preferably. It gives the person some level of respect and
      regards, portray you as someone who really is serious about his desires,
      and may earn you a positive response to your request better than putting a
      call through.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">4. Do Not Be A Nuisance</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">When communicating your needs to the person,
      let him know you only need a little of his time to clarify misunderstood
      points in class. Most highly effective students are always very busy. Even
      if they do not look like it, they really are. Be courteous when you deal
      with them, they have their lives to live too. So do not constitute
      nuisance to them. Most times, more often than not, they have their days
      planned ahead of time. Do not just bump into their days uninformed, as
      though their primary reason for being in school is to help you succeed.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Thread with care. Be specific with time. You
      may plan to have them for an hour every weekend, or for half an hour in
      the evening of each day the lecture holds. Whichever it is, let it be an
      agreement between both parties, and keep strictly to it. If there is a
      need to increase the amount of time spent together, it will be obvious to
      both parties.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5. Do Not Be A Parasite</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not just let the relationship be a one
      sided relationship where he does all of the giving and you do all of the
      receiving. Make it a mutual relationship so that one party does not feel
      used or cheated with time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Bring something to the table too, no matter
      how small. You may buy a bottle of drink for him once in a while, or pay
      for his meal tickets. You may go out of your way to get for him past
      questions, study materials, or things that could make his academics a lot
      better than what it presently is. That way, you endear yourself to him the
      more.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">6. Be Appreciative</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Always express a vocal appreciation for his
      time after each study session. Do not take this for granted. At the end of
      the semester or after the exams, do not forget to send a ‘thank you’
      note/card to your academic friend for helping you through the duration of
      the course.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If affordable, a small gift will be more
      ideal. If well done, this can serve as a key that will open the door of
      the heart of the person to you again when school resumes for a new
      session.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">7. Be Focused</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">One thing you also must be careful of is
      lost focus. As the relationship gets deeper, you may begin to lose the
      primary purpose of the network, most especially if the two of you discover
      some common areas of interests which were not known to both parties
      before, say, both of you like the game of chess, or both are fans of the
      same football club.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If this is not carefully handled, more of
      the time spent together which should be used in studying classwork, may be
      spent on either discussing on, or engaging in the other common area of
      interest.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Lost focus can also threaten a good academic
      partnership if the two parties involved are of the opposite sex and are
      not matured enough to handle their emotions without allowing their
      feelings becloud their sense of reasoning.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">To guard against lost focus, you will need
      to determine aforehand the primary purpose of every network you are
      building, and to constantly remind yourself of this purpose. This may
      serve as a check and balance on this relationship.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">B. GENERAL TUTORING</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The second type of networking among students
      for better academic results is General Tutoring. This is a way of passing
      across relevant information in a particular course, in an interactive,
      more specific and less formal way than the class lecture. It is a good
      part of the learning process in the higher institution.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is sometimes referred to as Tutorial
      Class, Discussion Class, Students Participatory Group, or Group
      Discussions. Unlike the One-on-One tutoring, these always involve more
      than two students. Although it is advisable to limit such to a sizable
      number of students, but in some developing countries, the number could be
      outrageous.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In General Tutoring, a number of students
      who are better than one another in different courses come together to
      teach one another what each one knows.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In some cases, a group of students who have
      problems with a particular course or topic seek the help of a classmate
      who seems better than them all in such course. They all gather together in
      a place, while the better student acts in the place of a lecturer,
      teaching them what he knows.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">At times, it involves discussing what each
      person knows about a particular topic in a course, such that everyone
      learns from his tutorial partners, as well as the tutorial leader. This
      can be real fun as it has a way of showing you how much you have learnt of
      what you were taught in class and how much more you will need to learn.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In a generation where every student is
      struggling to excel more than his course-mates, tutorial classes have
      become a major resort for a better academic performance. Every student
      needs take advantage of this opportunity to learn more so as to earn extra
      mark, especially in this age that one hears rampant reports of students
      committing suicide for not living up to their own (or their parents')
      academic expectations.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">One major advantage of Tutorial classes is
      that it builds up your confidence in the examination hall. Once you have
      tackled the topic in question in the tutorial class, and you have heard
      the opinions of other students, shared what you know, added to what you
      are taught in class, you will approach the examination question from such
      topics with so much confidence knowing for sure that you know all that is
      expected of you to know as regards the topics.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Differences Between A Lecture And A Tutorial
      Class</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The tutorial classes differ from lectures in
      a number of ways. While the lecture is a large class which takes place at
      a venue approved by the school authority, the tutorial class is a rather</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">smaller class of very few students and can
      take place anywhere, from under a big tree in the school garden, to the
      room of one of the tutorial partners.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Secondly, during a lecture, a university
      academic addresses the whole class and there is little or no time for
      every student to engage in personal discussions. Students are forced to
      accept whatever the lecturer says as the complete truth, without any
      argument that may arise from curiosity. However, in tutorial classes
      everyone is given an opportunity to share what he knows or ask what he yet
      needs to know about the topic under discussion, even the dumbest person in
      the group.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Thirdly, while attendance in lectures is
      very compulsory and may count in your final examination results at the end
      of the semester in some schools, the tutorial class is not compulsory but
      it is highly recommended that you attend. If you miss a tutorial class,
      you may not be too concerned because no academic mark is awarded for it;
      you only miss the opportunity to learn more.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, if your reason for missing the
      tutorial class is so genuine, and you have a good rapport with your
      tutorial partners, you may plead with them to do a repeat of the topic for
      your sake, but no lecturer will organize a repeat lecture simply because
      one student missed the class, no matter who the student it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Advantages Of Discussion Group</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1. Discussion groups give students
      opportunity to clarify confusing points during a lecture. Discussing with
      other students helps them to achieve a deeper understanding of the topic.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2. It also provides opportunity to widen the
      scope of what they know by listening to what several others have to say
      about the topic under discussions. They hear different experiences and
      exposures in addition to what the teacher has taught in class. This
      expands their viewpoints about the topics discussed.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">3. A good tutorial class will help the
      students to think by stimulating their reasoning, helping them to recall
      what was learnt and giving them more ample opportunities to reflect on it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">4. It also fosters positive group
      interaction among discussants.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5. It increases a student's verbal
      communication skills. It helps build the courage to stand and speak boldly
      in front of others.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">6. It makes the participants discover areas
      where they still need more reinforcements in their academics.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">7. It gives the students multiple ways to
      remember and retain whatever information they have learnt</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">How To Lead A Study Group</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">So many students lead a tutorial group
      without knowing how to effectively lead one. They just assume that since
      they know what the topic is all about, that is all that is needed to lead
      the group. No wonder most tutorial groups do not last beyond the time of a
      class test or an examination.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In order to lead a study group successfully,
      there are things you need to learn. Some of them are discussed below:</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1. Know The Style Of The Examiner</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In order to lead a Study Group successfully,
      you will first need to know the style and preferences of the lecturer
      handling the course in school. This you can do by getting in touch with
      some senior colleagues whom the lecturer had taught before.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some lecturers will prefer that you answer
      their examination questions precisely the way they had taught you in
      class; word for word, no more, no less. To this type of lecturer, if you
      go beyond his class notes to give him much more than he has given you, he
      may feel you really do not know the specific answers to the particular
      questions and that you are just perambulating around it. He likely may
      fail you, or at best, give you less than you actually deserve. This will
      not be too fair on you, because in your bid to boost your G.P., every
      single mark matters.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some other lecturers prefer that you deliver
      far much more than they have given you in the lecture hall. They expect
      you to answer the questions the best way you understand, supporting
      yourself with day to day examples and quoting from other research works
      you have consulted at your personal study period. To these lecturers, if
      you just give to them in the examination hall only what they give to you
      in the lecture hall, they may easily conclude that you are a lazy student
      who have not done your proper home work, and who does not deserve to get
      the best of their scores, or worse still, fail you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">So, before you start the tutorial class,
      know what the style of the lecturer is and lead the group accordingly.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2. Have A Good Grip On The Course</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Since you will have to lead the group in the
      discussion, you will need to have a solid grip on either the total course
      content, or at least, specifically on the topic to be discussed for the
      day. You will need to have a thorough knowledge of the subject theme.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This will mean that you will invest some
      hours before the tutorial time, going through relevant materials to brush
      up what you already know and to acquaint yourself with what may still look
      strange to you. You cannot afford not to know so well what you intend to
      teach so many.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you do not have a good grip of the topic
      under discussion, the people in your Study Group will know, and will
      likely see you as an inefficient leader. This may lead to either choosing
      another leader or deserting your Study Group to join another. This may
      cause you some embarrassment amidst your fellow classmates, bearing in
      mind that students are good at polite mockeries and jests.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The idea for the study group may be
      conceived by you, but if you really do not have what it takes
      academically, you do not have to be the group leader. To lead the group,
      you really do not have to know as much as the lecturer will know, but you
      also do not have to be the dullest in the group.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">3. Prepare The Group Ahead Of The Class
      Discussion</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Set definite and precise expectations for
      each session of the tutorial class. Let everyone know ahead of time what
      to expect and let them prepare ahead of discussion time. You may announce
      what to expect at the next group discussion at the end of every discussion
      class. This will accord everyone enough time to prepare.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the class notes, you may also
      make recommendations on what chapters of which textbooks to read. This
      makes the group discussions less boring to all, as everyone to an extent,
      will have something noteworthy to contribute. This will ensure a very
      robust, meaningful and extensive discussion each time they meet, and the
      participating students will always look forward to it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Impressive and appetizing discussions rarely
      happen without the contribution of others. If they must contribute
      meaningfully, they must prepare in advance. Help the students prepare for
      the discussions by suggesting a list of questions for each discussion
      session, suggest key concepts and areas of concentration to focus on when
      preparing for the discussion.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">4. Provide A Conducive Atmosphere</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The atmosphere must be comfortable enough
      for students to want to discuss with each other. So, intentionally choose
      a venue that all of the participants will feel at home with. It could be
      someone's room, the hostel's common room, a vacant class, a quiet lecture
      theater, a garden, or wherever. But everyone must be comfortable with, and
      in such atmosphere.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Once the group members start raising
      objections to a particular venue, it is time to start looking out for a
      replacement. You do not have to bother your head too much with what the
      replacement will be anyway, you can ask every one of them to make
      suggestions, and you all make the best choice of the available options.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5. Engage Everyone</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Keep everyone active, either by engaging
      them in sharing with the group or make them reflect on what has been
      discussed already, and let them share their opinion on them. If only the
      same set of students talk every time, it is no longer a group discussion,
      it has become a lecture. Let every participant understand that academic
      discussions are vital to efficient learning.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In order to help those who naturally will
      not want to talk publicly, you may even set a mild rule, something like,
      ‘no one is allowed to say “I do not know it” in this discussion group’.
      Everyone truly may not know everything, but everyone is expected to think.
      They may not know the accurate answers, but they can think of a likely
      answer, guess, speculate or think aloud, especially if they had read about
      the topic before the discussion class as announced by the group leader.
      This will help everyone in the group to move away from the simple, narrow,
      agree/disagree formula that governs most public lectures and general
      classes.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You may even help them by aiming your
      questions directly at those who do not always want to talk, it compels
      them to participate.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">6. Manage Time</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is also your responsibility as a group
      leader to manage the time. Ensure that the time allocated for discussion
      classes in the semester is shared equally among the courses you are
      offering, such that no course suffers at the expense of the other.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Also ensure that in each session, each
      person keeps to his allocated time and that no single individual dominates
      the discussion unreasonably. Ensure that all group members are heard
      equally, most especially those who have something relevant to say.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">7 Mediate Conflicts</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Wherever there are groups of people, there
      are bound to be diverse view points as regard issues. From time to time,
      due to these differences in opinion, arguments may arise which may lead to
      serious misunderstandings among members of the group. This, if not
      attended to on time may degenerate to conflicts which may breed hatred
      among discussion group members. Ensure that you mediate in each conflict
      before it degenerates to that level.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">When an academic argument arises, let the
      students know that the group discussion is not about who wins the argument
      but about what every person gains from other person’s point of view as
      regards the topic in question. It is better to listen to others’ views so
      as to learn from them, and not good enough to merely sit idly, waiting for
      an opportunity to make their own presentation of what they know simply
      because they want to proof the other person wrong. If this becomes the
      main focus, the primary purpose of the discussion group becomes defeated.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You may likely have foul-mouthed students
      who may be abusive, discourteous, disruptive, and unmannerly in your study
      group. These students, most times, use their bad manners to cover up their
      lack of knowledge of the topic under discussions, raising sentimental
      feelings instead of discussing facts. They make discriminatory statements
      and hateful speech. When you notice this, always intervene on time and let
      them know how hurtful their comments are to others.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You may call such aside and speak privately
      to him about his behavioral attitude. If he refuses to change, you may
      consider excluding him from your group before he does more harm. Allow
      anyone to reasonably disagree with the comments of others but let them do
      this without attacking the personalities of others in the group.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">8. Clarify Responses</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Clarify other students’ responses when
      necessary. It is important that no one leaves the place confused. Whenever
      you discover someone has said something which is either totally or
      partially untrue, be ready to clarify the point before the group is
      dismissed.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You may ask the student to rephrase himself
      or explain his comments. You may ask him questions to help him clarify
      himself. If you think he is not doing justice to the topic, you may ask
      someone to help out. However, you will need to do this maturely if you do
      not want to create enmity among your group members.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Respect everyone's opinion, but always stand
      for the truth.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">9. Keep The Focus</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is very easy for students to go off track
      without knowing it. Discussions can drift from the main focus to some less
      relevant issues that still affect most or all of the students
      participating in the tutorial class. This happens from time to time at
      group discussions and wastes a lot of precious time that could be spent
      discussing vital points.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Vital academic discussions start from point
      A, and after several contributions from others, you discover the
      discussion is now on point D, which, most times, is not scheduled to be</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">discussed, has no direct impact on the
      subject being treated, and none whatsoever on the student’s academic
      performance in school.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">How the discussion move from point A through
      point B and C until it gets to point D may not be intentional. It is your
      responsibility as a group leader to always ensure that the group stays on
      planned topics at every time. Know the boundary of the topics to cover,
      and also know when the class is going beyond such boundaries to other
      things that may take your focus away from the circumference of the
      expected area of the discussion.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Always know when to step in and refocus the
      group discussion. But be flexible about it. If the discussion is
      beneficial to the group, and relevant to their academic success, you may
      allow it for a while. However, as the leader of the group, always be at
      alert to ensure that such discussions do not completely displace the real
      subject of discussion at such times.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Always ensure that the group is strictly
      focused on what needs to be done per time. If the discussion is not
      beneficial to all and it is irrelevant to their academics, it should not
      be allowed to disturb the main thing that brought the group together. If
      it is for everybody’s good, and it can wait till a later time, it can be
      rescheduled to be discussed at a separate meeting.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If it is urgent and cannot wait till a later
      time, you may wish to first conclude the agenda of the day, which is the
      topic under discussion, and then use the spare time to discuss the issue.
      This way, no one will feel offended, as students who find the discussion
      irrelevant can beg to take their leave, having fulfilled their desire for
      the day.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">10. Limit Your Involvement</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Carefully avoid the temptation to talk too
      much or the urge to respond personally to every participant’s submissions.
      Always remember, it is a discussion class, not a lecture hall. As much as
      other students are not allowed to monopolize the discussions, you also
      should not.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Allow adequate time for others to discuss.
      Good discussions take some time to gather momentum, some more time to
      peak, before finally stirring up serious inputs. Intentionally limit your
      involvements, delegating more to other students in the group.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">11. Establish Rules Of Engagement</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Establish rules that will enhance general
      participation, curtail excesses, help participants to tolerate each other,
      especially people with opposing views. These rules, if made early enough,
      will save you some unnecessary headaches.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">These rules of engagements will address
      salient factors that need to be taken care of in order to have more
      efficient discussion periods. Some of them are:</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(a) Who should speak, how long should he
      speak, and how often should he speak in a discussion class?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(b) If more than one student volunteer to
      speak at the same time, who should speak first, and who should speak next,
      and for how long. What criteria should be considered in choosing who
      speaks first?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(c) If no one volunteers to speak, who
      should bell the cat, and then who will be next?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(d) Who is attentive and who is not, and
      what should be done to make those who are not attentive very attentive?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(e) When the discussion begins to lose
      steam, what needs to be done to reenergize it?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(f) How do you control the people when
      emotions begin to run too high, the exchange of words becomes heated and
      the atmosphere tense and threatening?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(g) Where the discussion started from, where
      it is at any particular time, where it is heading to, and where it
      actually needs to head to.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">These and many more rules of engagements
      will help you manage the group more effectively.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">12. Summarize</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Close all discussions formally by personally
      summarizing what has been discussed or requesting any of the discussants
      to do a quick recap of things learnt at the end of each tutorial so as to
      enforce the lecture more in the hearts of all present.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Getting The Best From A Tutorial Class</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You may not be the one leading the tutorial
      group, but you also will need to consciously take some steps to get the
      best from the discussion class, or else it will just become another avenue
      to waste your precious time on campus, without adding anything positive to
      your life or your academics. There is a level of freedom in the tutorial
      class that is not found in the classroom. This freedom could make students
      misbehave or act irrationally amidst other students. You will need to be
      careful how you portray yourself such that this freedom will not become an
      hindrance to your getting the best from the tutorial class.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1. Focus On What Is Important</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The tutorial class in not a place where you
      read your class notes or textbooks line by line, that should have been
      done before then. If you have not done it before the discussion class
      starts, it is better to place it on hold until after the discussion group,
      so that you can focus on what is important at the moment, which is
      learning from someone who has studied his before the time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">For purely theoretical courses, a lot of
      materials in the syllabus module, school curriculum, course outline,
      scheme of work and reference books are totally irrelevant from the
      examination point of view. They are more useful in real life situations
      and contain much more than is needed to pass a school examination. If your
      reason for joining a tutorial group is to get better academic grades,
      thereby boosting your G.P., knowing what to focus on during a tutorial
      class, from the class notes, textbooks or other study materials will save
      you a whole lot of time and energy.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2. Be Willing To Learn</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is not compulsory for you to speak if you
      do not have something meaningful to say about the ongoing discussions. It
      is ok to lose your turn and allow another person to speak. Keeping silent
      is better than saying things that make you look stupid and sound foolish.
      More so, it saves everybody some precious time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">However, do not always put yourself in this
      situation where you will not have anything meaningful to say. Always
      prepare ahead of the discussions so that you also can contribute
      intelligently.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">3. Get The Best Of The Tutorial</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In each of the session, focus more on exam
      oriented part of the lecture which you either fail to understand in class
      or failed in a class test. The temptation for each participating student
      may be to say something that he already knows, so that other students can
      respect him as being brilliant. But your purpose of attendance is not for
      others to respect you, but to learn what you missed in class so as to earn
      more marks in the school exams. If you are able to achieve this purpose,
      you will earn better respect from the group.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">4. Take Notes</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not just make an appearance simply to
      mark an attendance. Do not sit idly watching the lips of others speak.
      Take comprehensive notes. Write down every new thing you hear about the
      topic under discussion. Things will be said by your mates in the
      discussion class that were not said by the lecturer in the class. Once it
      is confirmed that these things are correct and very relevant to the
      subject matter, note them down. They may come in handy someday.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5. Respect Others’ Contribution</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Respect other peoples’ opinions and
      contributions. If you do not quite understand the point the other person
      is making, rather than shout him down, ask him for clarifications. One
      good way to learn is to see things from others’ perspectives before
      crucifying them, especially when their perspectives are different from
      yours.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">C. ONLINE TUTORING</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The third type of networking available to
      students is called Online Tutoring. This is not too common yet, but with
      the uncontrollable outburst of affection for social media sites among
      students, it has what it takes to become the most common type of student
      network in years to come.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This tutoring is done through social media
      sites. A group of students who are connected to the internet, and who are
      registered with the same social network provider, can decide to have an
      online discussion on a particular topic at a specified time. This can run
      like a Twitter class, or a Blackberry channel, Whatsapp group, facebook
      chat, etc, where everyone who is in the group can contribute to the
      discussion or read whatever everyone else is contributing.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The beauty of this is that the students do
      not have to gather together in a real place. It is a virtual gathering.
      Irrespective of the actual distance between them, everyone meets online at
      the same time to discuss the same issue.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This eliminates the time spent to transport
      each participant to and fro the place of meeting, saves each person the
      cost and the risks of such transportation, and allows everyone to stay in
      the comfort of their homes and still benefit from the group discussions.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This can be done anywhere. You can even form
      a group among your classmates. All you need to do is to ensure that all
      discussants are on the same social media network. You can specifically
      create a group chat on any social app for this singular purpose. You may
      also want to use an existing group chat which you are part of already and
      which contains a high</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">number of your course mates. Just introduce
      the idea to them, that rather than just discuss irrelevant issues every
      time, a particular time can be set aside, that all will agree with, for
      discussing purely academic issues, say thrice a week. These sessions can
      be divided amidst the courses you are offering, and everybody contributes,
      while you lead the group, or assign someone else to do so.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">On a larger scale, some upward looking
      personnel are already taking advantage of this new generations’
      overpowering addiction to screens and craze for gadgets to
      develop sites that can enhance students’ academic performances. On such
      sites, students from all over the world can ask other students or scholars
      from other institutions questions about their class works and researches,
      and get answers from a number of authorities in the field, all at the same
      time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>LAST WARNING</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Take this last warning: For a full time
      student, no amount of tutorial classes attended will take the place of
      either your personal study hours or lecture hours. Each of these is
      complementary to the others and not designed to replace any other.
      Therefore, beware not to misplace your priority!</p>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">LIVE A BALANCED LIFE</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In order to boost your G.P, you need to live
      a very balanced life on campus. There are these three areas of your life
      that on the surface may look as though has nothing to do with your
      academic performance but actually has a lot to do with boosting your
      G.P. if well examined. These three factors will be discussed
      briefly in this chapter. They are:</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A. Regular Exercise</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">B. Good Nutrition</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">C. Adequate Sleep/Rest</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(A) REGULAR EXERCISE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The enormous demand that follows being an
      undergraduate student in any higher institution is very high and it comes
      with its own stress. This stress is generated through tight schedules,
      continuous classes, assignments, social functions and other unavoidable
      obligations. One of the best ways to deal with this stress is regular
      exercises.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The general fitness of the body and the
      overall alertness of the mind are tightly linked together. New findings
      from biology and education researches have shown that regular exercise
      benefits the brain in numerous ways. In order to be very effective as a
      student, you will need a sound mind in a healthy body. If your body is not
      healthy enough, your mind, no matter how active, will be limited in its
      delivery. Every scholar needs a body that is fit enough to give expression
      to whatever goes on in his mind.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">These exercises may be just anything which
      gets targeted areas of your body parts moving for a definite time
      specification. It may be as simple as briskly walking the distance from
      your lecture hall to the hostel, jogging, running, hiking, swimming,
      dancing, riding a bicycle, using various exercise equipments or taking
      weekly physical fitness classes as much as time will permit you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the higher institutions in the
      country are flavored with very beautiful, often state-of-the-art sports
      complex with exercise facilities, many of which are available
      free-of-charge for the usage of their students. In many schools, these
      facilities may include a swimming pool,</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">table tennis courts, lawn tennis courts,
      basketball courts, badminton, or football field, with enough space for
      aerobics and track events. However, most students hardly near it. So many
      students spend too much time studying (or pretending to do) that they do
      not find time to fit exercise into their schedule, forgetting that you
      need a sound body in order to demonstrate a sound mind.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You need to realize that it is better for
      you to take advantage of what is free while you still have the
      opportunity. You will likely have to pay if you decide to join a gym or
      use a workout facility outside your campus. Why not take advantage of the
      opportunity you have today, when it is still available!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some students’ excuses have been that the
      school gymnasium hall is far from their halls of residence, and so they
      easily get discouraged whenever they think of the distance to cover and
      the time it will take to get there and to return back. You need to know
      that regular exercise does not necessarily need to take place in the gym
      or the school sport complex. It can also be done in the corner of your
      room, using small weights, exercise balls, exercise bands etc.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Decide on an activity you will love to do
      for exercise. To know if the exercise is effective or not, check if you
      actually sweat while engaging in it or if the rate of your heartbeat
      increased minutes after the exercise is concluded. Any simple activity
      that gets your heart rate beat up faster and cause you to lose some sweat
      is good enough to start with, even if it means just running up and down a
      set of stairs for ten minutes every morning or dancing!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As much as possible, whether you decide to
      do it in the gym with friends, in an aerobics class with an instructor, or
      just in the corner of your room alone, make time for daily workouts. Put
      it on your regular schedule the way you would any other appointment.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Another excuse students give against regular
      exercise is the time; most of them cannot afford to spare the enormous
      time needed for it, considering other things that is demanding for their
      time. The truth is that effective and productive exercise does not really
      need to happen all at once. If you discover that you are a very busy
      student with numerous things to attend to, and it seems the time available
      is not even enough to do the things that are really important, talk less
      of squeezing out time for exercises, you may find ways to fit exercise
      into your schedule in bits and pieces.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you cannot afford a daily routine, you
      may do with at least three different 20 to 30 minutes sessions in a week.
      If you cannot spare that much in a week, any amount of exercise is better
      than none. The more you get, though, the better.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A few minutes of running now, a brief table
      tennis game later, cycling to the eatery for lunch and the likes will all
      add up for something for you. If possible, you may choose to trek to class
      some mornings from the school gate, instead of taking a campus shuttle.
      You may decide to take the stairs instead of making use of the elevator.
      All of these, in a sense, will also help you. They are also forms of
      exercise, though hidden, but intentional, and not less effective if well
      done.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Advantages Of Regular Exercise To Students</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1. GENERATES ENERGY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is very possible to find yourself
      exhausted on a day you have actually accomplished little or nothing; this
      happens to everyone from time to time. No lectures, no fellowship
      activities, no sporting activities, nothing really important is done all
      day, yet you feel like a log of wood, dead tired.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The simple explanation for this is that the
      body generates its own energy correspondingly with the task at hand. With
      little or nothing done for the day, the body generates little or no
      energy. This is the reason one feels tired, even without doing anything,
      since there is no energy generated by the body to drive any passion.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">To generate more energy, you only need to
      increase your level of activity. Each time you discover that you feel
      tired with no energy to study, and the reason is not because you have done
      quite enough for the day, all you need is to allow your body generates for
      itself the energy needed to do the task at hand.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Rather than just give up easily and retire
      to bed, as most students will do, just take a break and get yourself 10
      minutes of light exercise. You will feel a new zeal of energy pumped into
      your system. This will carry you through whatever you are required to do
      at the moment.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2. NOURISHES BRAIN TISSUE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Every muscle in the human body becomes
      stronger with exercise. The stronger the muscle, the healthier the part of
      the body that it controls and the better that part of the body functions.
      The operations of the brain tissues can be likened to that of the body
      muscles.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Regular exercise makes the brain tissue
      stronger thereby making it deliver at maximal capacity. This will favor
      your academics in a lot of ways. Exercises stimulate the development of
      the brain cells. Most experiments conducted in recent times about human
      and animal behavior have revealed that when one engages in regular aerobic
      exercises, it produces profound effects on the brain.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Generally, aerobic exercise pumps more blood
      throughout the body, including to the brain. More blood means more oxygen
      and therefore, better-nourished brain tissue.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In a recent article published in New York
      Times, the results of various experiments that was performed on mice at
      the University of Illinois was summarized. Mice that were made to run
      regularly on a particular wheel had more brain cells, than those who were
      not. It was also noticed that the mice who ran regularly had more complex
      connections between the neurons in their body. This means they were able
      to access their brain cells more flexibly than the other mice. Lastly, the
      mice who ran regularly did better on reasoning tests, such as completing a
      maze. The research was also able to prove with evidence that this direct
      relationship also exists in humans; regular exercise causes an enhancement
      in brain activity.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">3. MEMORY RETENTION</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There is a structure in the brain whose
      primary function is to control the formation, retention and recall of
      memories; it is called the “hippocampus”. (It is so amusing to me
      personally, that there is “campus” in the spelling of its name, showing
      the relationship between it and campus activities. That is just on a
      lighter mood.) This structure, the hippocampus, as important as it is to
      every student’s academic excellence, begins to shrink once one is about 20
      years old, thereby reducing its efficiency and resulting in gradual memory
      loss over time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Studies from the same experiments mentioned
      above shows that regular exercise will prevent this shrinkage, and in a
      case where it has shrunk considerably, regular exercise may even promote
      its regrowth.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Every student must be interested in this, if
      not for anything, at least for the fact that regular exercise will benefit
      the part of your brain which helps you to retain and recall information
      taught in class or read during personal study, which is the major
      challenge of many students, the ability to retain and recall whenever its
      needed the things learnt in school. How interesting it is to know that
      staying in shape makes you smarter.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">4. INCREASE CONCENTRATION LEVEL</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A Canadian Special School experimented 20
      minutes of exercise on treadmills or bikes for some of their students
      before their mathematics class. The teachers discovered a significant
      development in the participating student’s ability to concentrate,
      participate and retain information during the class after they had
      exercised, compared to those who did not.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Contrary to old beliefs that morning
      exercise makes students agitated and disorderly in class, it has been
      discovered from this experiment that the opposite is true. Students
      involved in the experiment were found to be less overexcited, more
      concentrating, and better behaved in class compared with kids who have
      been sitting in chairs for hours on end.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This proves that engaging in brief exercise,
      say between 10 to 15 minutes daily, can make significant improvement in
      your concentration level in class. It helps you to focus more
      constructively on problems.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5. BOOSTS YOUR MOOD</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Students need positive attitude to succeed;
      constant mood swings affect academics adversely. However, most students
      always have these mood changes, especially females. These mood swings may
      be due to depression caused by academic pressures, financial obligations,
      breakage in romantic relationships or whatever.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is why you need some daily exercise.
      Numerous studies have shown that exercise profoundly improves one’s mood.
      It helps students feel better about themselves. One of such studies done
      by Tufts University indicated that students who exercise are generally
      happier.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Regular exercise or physical activity helps
      many of the body’s systems function better. It helps you to boost your
      mood so that you may ultimately boost your G.P.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">6. RELIEVES STRESS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Bodily exercise generally helps you to
      relief stress. Preparing for major exams can be very stressful. Taking
      lectures all mornings, sitting down to do personal study all noon and
      revising all evening can be very exhaustive with adverse effects on some
      parts of the body. You may develop a knee cramp, muscle spasm, swollen
      leg, back pain, sore foot, and the likes, depending on how uncomfortable
      the reading room is, and the suitability of your reading table and the
      seat you use. These stress, if prolonged, can lead to more severe health
      problems</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Taking 15 minutes off for some light
      exercises after a prolonged personal study session can be refreshing and
      restorative. It releases the stress naturally and decreases the built up</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">tensions without using any medications. It
      helps you to sleep better thereby easing out anxiety and relieving the
      negative effects of stress on your body.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(B) GOOD NUTRITION</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Eating a balanced diet (or good nutrition as
      you may call it) can be defined as physically consuming on daily basis the
      required substances the body needs to grow and to function at its best.
      Physical activity, combined with good nutrition can have great impact on a
      student’s potential to learn.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Poor nutrition, on the other hand, has its
      adverse effects on students and on their academic performance. The body of
      evidence to support the positive effects of a healthy and varied diet on
      one’s I.Q. is so large and may not be necessary to reproduce a lot of them
      here.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In a New York experiment performed among
      university students, most of the students studied experienced malnutrition
      that one may think was too slight for clinical signs, yet it still
      affected their intelligence and academic performance during the time of
      the malnourishment.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some researchers at Purdue University
      conducted a research to investigate how diet affects the memory, using
      rats as a study case. Two different diets were compared. The first group
      of rats, say Group A was giving a standard laboratory rat diet, while the
      second group of rats, say Group B was giving a high-energy diet with a
      higher percentage of sugar and fat, compared to the first.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Before the introduction of these diets, the
      two groups of rats were trained to perform certain tasks that required
      memorization of some certain skills. Four weeks after the introduction of
      their respective diets, the rats were tested again to determine how well
      they remembered to perform the tasks they had learnt before.
      Interestingly, the researchers noticed that some of the rats on the
      high-energy meal gained less weight than other rats on the same diet. They
      called the rats that gained less weight “diet-resistant” rats.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The researchers found that the rats fed with
      the high-energy diet had impaired performance on previously-learned tasks,
      and that this impaired memory was greatest in the rats that had gained the
      most body fat; which means the decrease in memory was associated not only
      with the diet but also with the amount of body fat. The result of this
      research summarized in one word; what you eat may determine how well you
      perform academically.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A good diet, like you learnt in your post
      primary school should contain six major classes of food; vitamins,
      proteins, mineral salt, fats and oil, carbohydrate, and water. The overall
      consumption of a student’s eating pattern must reflect all of these, if
      not every day, at least as often as your pocket can afford. Once one of
      these is lacking in your regular food intake, there is likely going to be
      a deficiency in the performance of some part of your brain. This is even
      more obvious from the primary school stage. You would have noticed while
      growing up that kids who lived in wealthy neighborhood and attended better
      schools always performed better on the average than others when opportune
      to meet in a competition. Except on very rare occasion will this not be
      the ideal.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most students are either unreasonably
      overfed with unbalanced diet or, in a bid to watch their weight, underfed
      with good nutrition. The paradox is that male students on our campuses eat
      a lot in order to fill their tummy, but most times, what they eat do not
      contain all the classes</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">of food that is required for growth and
      effectiveness. The females on the other hand will either take what can
      only be described as junk foods, or few bites of a nutritional meal so as
      to model themselves into the societal acceptable physical shape of an
      ideal lady.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Students from socioeconomically advantaged
      families may really not feel this brunch as much as students from low
      income families who always suffer more of this malnutrition. They hardly
      get to eat what they really desire to; they only make do with whatever is
      available to them. These ones suffer both food insufficiency and
      unbalanced diet.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Rather than junk foods for most part of the
      day, you may determine to reduce the junk intake and increase the amount
      of real food taken. You may also decide to increase your diet quality by
      beginning to use fresh fruits as snacks, rather than just consuming
      processed flour.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The association between diet quality and
      academic performance is great. Regular access to balanced nutrition,
      starting from the breakfast, will help students reach their full potential
      in their academics. One of the most important meals to students is the
      breakfast. However, if a research is conducted, one will be surprised to
      discover that more than 50% of students really do not take breakfast on
      daily basis. This may be attributed to the fact that they always sleep
      late, and consequently wake up late, and so may not be able to afford the
      time to either prepare their own breakfast or pick one up from the eatery.
      Breakfast eaters, no matter how light the meal is, always have better
      attention in class than breakfast skippers.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(C) ADEQUATE SLEEP</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Generally, students (comprising mainly of
      teenagers and youths) are the most sleep-deprived subset, if the whole
      world is assumed to be a universal set. The challenging lives they live
      can make it puzzling to maintain a healthy daily sleep habit. Most
      students do not get enough sleep. They often lead very busy and stressful
      lives, since they are groomed in a society where the candle burns at both
      ends. They stay awake all day to study and all night to catch fun.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The demands of the social life on campus and
      burdens of the academic works in school have placed increasing tension on
      their time, and more than ever before, most students are making up for
      those demands by cutting back on their sleep duration. For this reason,
      most students’ biological clock always runs late. This is why it is
      actually slightly difficult for them to either go to bed early or wake
      from sleep early.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">According to a research done by the Division
      of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, the body manages and requires
      sleep in much the same way that it regulates the need for eating,
      drinking, and breathing. These and several other studies consistently show
      that sleep plays a vital role in promoting physical health, longevity, and
      emotional well-being.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Just like good food, adequate sleep is
      necessary for every student. The duo, good food and good sleep, can both
      be referred to as necessary-life-sustaining-activities. Although some
      students appreciates the place of good nutrition for a fully functional
      mind, and so do not joke with food, but it is relatively difficult to say
      the same about their sleep habit. It seems most of them have not grasp the
      role that sleep serves, as much as that of eating.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Skipping your meals may produce an
      uncomfortable sensation of hunger; this serves as a reminder to warn you
      that something is going wrong which needs to be put right on time, and</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">that wrong is corrected only by eating. Just
      the same way, inadequate sleep makes you feel overwhelmingly drowsy, which
      is nature’s way of letting your body know that it has been denied
      satisfactory rest, and just as a good meal disperses hunger by nourishing
      the body with adequate nutrients, a good sleep also disperses sleepiness
      by cooling your nerves.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">SLEEP AND LEARNING</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If every student can get a better
      understanding of what sleep does to the body, they will be forced to
      respect sleep's functions more and enjoy the benefits it affords, both to
      their health and their academics.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A research done at Brown University found
      that approximately 11% of students report good sleep, while a huge 73%
      report poor sleep habits. Considering the lifestyle of students today, the
      result of this experiment will be close to the same, if not worse, if
      performed in any other higher institution in the world.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">More importantly, and of a greater concern
      is the fact that this same research also discovered that sleep deprivation
      in student is linked to lower GPAs. All the 11% of students who reported
      good sleep habit have better academic performance than the 73% who
      reported poor sleep habit. This research proves that the cost of poor
      sleep is much greater than many students know: it may have profound
      consequences on their academics, thereby affecting their G.P. negatively.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Learning, either in academic or otherwise,
      generally occurs at three different phases. The first is the Acquisition
      Phase during which information is introduced to the brain. This
      information may be entirely new or something that was learnt but long
      forgotten. The second phase is the Consolidation Phase, which refers to
      the combination of processes through which the memory registers this
      information in an easily retrievable file in the brain, creating a link
      between it and things already known. The third phase, which is the last,
      called the Recall Phase represents one’s ability to retrieve this stored
      information at will.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The first and the last phase occur during
      the waking hours. However, the second stage, the Consolidation Phase takes
      place during sleep. As you sleep, your brain is busy organizing and
      connecting memories. This is how sleep improves your memory.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This means that the quantity and quality of
      sleep allowed per day will have a profound impact on the consolidation of
      memory, which is essential for learning new information. It is bad enough
      that one may not be able to learn new information excellently well when
      sleep is deficient, but worse still, one still loses his ability to access
      previously learned information.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is why students should not joke with
      sleep. You can use this information about sleep as a tool to increase your
      productivity. When a student is sleep deprived, his focus, attention, and
      vigilance drifts, either in class or during personal study. This makes it
      more difficult for him to receive information. After a constant period of
      sleep deprivation, there are noticeable changes in what used to be a
      regular brain activity.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">STAGES OF SLEEP DEPRIVATION AMONG STUDENTS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Sleep deprivation can be experienced by
      students in three major ways:</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1) Complete Deprivation: This happens when a
      student decides not to sleep at all throughout the night for whatever
      reasons best known to him. It may be because he needs to</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">study for an exam that holds the next
      morning, or because of a social function he needs to attend all night.
      Whatever the excuse is, a whole night is spent, in addition to a whole day
      of activities, without allowing the brain time to rest, before resuming
      for the activities of the next day.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2) Partial Deprivation: This happens when a
      student steals out of his sleeping time to attend to some things he feels
      are at that moment more important than his sleep or health. This is done
      by either sleeping very late, or rising from bed too early, in other to
      make up for wasted time during the day. Whichever way it is done, he
      deprives himself of either the comfort that comes from going to bed early
      enough, or the refreshing feeling that comes from getting out of bed at
      the right time in the morning.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">3) Intermittent Deprivation: This happens
      when, no matter how early or how late one sleeps, one still finds reasons
      to deprive himself of good sleep at different stages or selective periods
      of the sleep for reasons best known to one. These varying levels of sleep
      disturbances students’ experience will most times amount to various types
      of mental performances the next day.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most students do not know what time to go to
      bed in order to have a quality sleep and debates may rise if one attempts
      to place a general time for them to sleep or to wake, because ‘too early’
      or ‘too late’ may be relative. However, your body clock knows what is best
      for you, and when you are sleep deprived, without anyone telling you, you
      will know it through the way you feel. Your biological sleep gauge will
      not measure up, ringing an alarm in your system that you need more. So,
      follow this body clock as long as it has not been tampered with through
      continuous poor sleep habit.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">NIGHT SLEEP</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">To get the best from your sleep, sleep more
      at night than during the day. There is nothing wrong with sleeping during
      the day if it is just to catch few minutes’ nap when one is tired.
      However, some students want to play all day and read all night. Then they
      feel sleepy the next morning and they make up for it by sleeping all they
      want in the noon time. This done, it is difficult to catch sleep early
      that night, so they decide to study or do something to whirl away the time
      all night again, until this becomes a normal cycle for them; they sleep
      during the day and study during the night. This ends up disrupting their
      sleep pattern, leading to a vicious cycle that may pose health risks over
      time if not adjusted.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">WEEKEND/HOLIDAY MAKE-UP PLAN</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">After overlaboring themselves during the
      week, denying themselves of sleep, some students will decide to make up
      for lost sleep during the week whenever they are chanced at weekends. So
      they sleep much longer during the weekend than they do during the day in
      order to make up for their sleep deficiency during the week.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some other students feel that once the
      holiday begins, there will be ample time for appropriate rest, but now
      that the exams are close, they want to invest the whole of the 24 hours of
      each day into their academics in order to make up for the time spent
      playing around school during the earlier part of the semester. This kind
      of lifestyle will only worsen your sleep habit.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is the reason many students always fall
      sick immediately after the exams, as they are about to begin their
      holidays. The body is already overworked, overstretched, and</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">overloaded. The ideal thing is to ensure you
      get a regular amount of sleep for as many nights as possible while the
      school is in session, and when necessary, stay a little longer in bed
      during weekends and holidays.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">BENEFITS OF SLEEP TO STUDENTS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Sleeping at night, for a student, is not
      just a waste of time, it is as indispensable to the brain as vitamin C is
      to the body, and when one deprives himself of it, he suffers several
      mental affliction, amidst other torments.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The benefit of sleep impacts nearly every
      area of our daily life. Every student knows that sleep is beneficial.
      However, most students really do not realize why it is so important. The
      side effects of not getting enough sleep as a student can reflect in the
      immediate and also extend to the farther future.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Generally, the primary price paid for
      deficient sleep is always poor health. Various studies have revealed that
      those who sleep poorly are at risk of major health problems on the long
      run. Chronic sleep deprivation may lead to problems including obesity,
      diabetes, high blood pressure, and other cardiovascular diseases, or even
      early mortality.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most students will sincerely admit that,
      whenever they deny their body the adequate sleep hours it needs, it
      affects their performance ability all through the day. Discussed below are
      some of the benefits of qualitative sleep and the short term consequences
      of inadequate sleep. For want of space, we will just limit this to how it
      affects students and their academics alone.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">AFFECTS YOUR JUDGEMENT</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Inadequate sleep will take its toll on your
      perception of issues and your sense of reasoning, which will eventually
      affect your judgment of the same. This will be evident in the high rate of
      errors noticeable in functions that one performs regularly and excellently
      prior to the time the body is denied sleep.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There have been enough reports from students
      who prepared for an examination adequately, but mistakenly sacrificed
      their sleep for the time of preparation, studying all night just before
      the morning of the examination. The sleep loss always takes a toll on them
      in the examination hall. Most of them complain of experiencing migraines,
      blurred visions, inability to reason straight, and lack of focus on the
      question at hand, all of these because of poor quality sleep. They
      experience decrement in their level of productivity, reduced efficiency,
      and increased errors. Most of them have ended up performing below their
      average performance in such examination, despite their high level of
      preparation.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">MENTAL ALERTNESS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The most immediate and generally common
      result of sleep deficiency is sleepiness. Many students experience this in
      class daily. It may come as general fatigue, lack of motivation, or even
      the most common experience of nodding off while in class. These correspond
      to a lower level of alertness and a general propensity to sleep.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Adequate sleep makes students more attentive
      in class. Many recent studies have substantiated the fact that students’
      mental resources are continuously depleted throughout the day as they rush
      around madly trying to squeeze as much as they can into every waking hour
      in order to meet deadlines.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A good restful sleep restores all the energy
      you have expended during the previous day. This is why, each morning you
      wake up from sleep, you feel better than you felt before you slept the
      previous night. You become more alert, more energetic, refreshed and
      healthier, ready for the new day’s tasks.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">ABILITY TO LEARN AND RETAIN INFORMATION</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Students who consistently fail to get enough
      sleep due to the kind of lifestyle they choose to live on campus are at an
      increased risk of graduating with poor academic degrees. Inadequate sleep
      will affect your ability to do well in your academics. What many students
      do not realize is that a lack of sleep, especially on a regular basis, is
      associated with difficulty in learning fresh information and difficulty in
      retaining them if learnt by any means. Since your perception is already
      hampered and efficiency reduced; this slows down your rate of assimilation
      in class.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Whenever you are asleep, your brain is
      actively working in order to consolidate the things learnt by creating new
      pathways amidst things known before and things just learnt for easy recall
      of either of the two. This facilitates an increased performance in the
      speed and accuracy of students who observed quality sleep compared with
      those who do not.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">For every sleep derived student, there is a
      noticeable decrease in the level of academic performance early in the
      morning, a time when the mind should deliver at its best to any student.
      This is because the mind becomes divided between the lecture and
      sleepiness, which makes one lose concentration from time to time, thereby
      missing out on what the lecturer says.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Students who are sleep deprived will also
      begin to show deficits in many tasks that require logical reasoning or
      complex thought. There is a fluctuation in their ability to function well
      academically. A sleep-deprived student finds it difficult to focus his
      attention optimally and therefore cannot learn efficiently. Healthy sleep
      is highly essential for optimal learning and memory function.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">KEEPS YOU HEALTHY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Everyday activities such as going to class,
      studying after lectures, or working on a computer can strain one’s body.
      The physical effects of this stress can produce ‘wear and tear’ on the
      body and degenerate its cells, making the body lose some vital nutrients.
      This propels the aging process.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As a result of this, the body has some
      restorative functions which it needs to perform from time to time, like
      the growth of muscles, tissue repair, protein synthesis, but the growth
      hormones needed for this self-repair is released mostly, or in some cases
      only, during sleep hours. Each time you sleep, the body generates
      additional protein molecules which help to strengthen your body’s ability
      to fight infection and stay healthy. These molecules help your immune
      system to fix your body whenever you are overstressed.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is one way good sleep keeps your body
      healthy. This key hormones released while you sleep helps your body to
      fight off common infections. Quantitative and qualitative sleep helps to
      reinstate whatever the body has lost during the day. It provides the body
      ample time to repair and rejuvenate itself. It slows down the aging
      effects by restoring the worn out cells.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is the same reason people who are sick
      always find themselves sleeping often when on medication. It is to create
      the time needed by the body to get itself repaired by creating the
      enabling environment the body needs to speed up the healing process.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">MOOD REORDER</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the many activities, parties,
      outings, late classes or other distractions on campus, which robs students
      of their precious sleep periods, so many of the students carry around a
      ‘sleep deficit nature.’ This sleep deficit nature, which is attributed
      singularly to lack of adequate sleep most times, affects the moods of
      students during the day.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The fatigue experienced after a night of
      sleep deficiency will put you in a pitiable shape the next day. This will
      consequently result in a very bad mood, where you become unnecessarily
      touchy, unfriendly, dull, quick tempered, grumpy, and you are just a
      shadow of yourself. It is even possible that some of your very close
      friends begin to wonder what the problem is with you, since their
      perception of you is different from what they used to know. This is what
      sleep deprivation can cause you in the immediate.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond the immediate, denying yourself
      enough sleep can have profound consequences on your health and mental
      well-being in the long-term. If a single sleepless night is strong enough
      to give you mood disorder, causing you to be irritable and temperamental
      the next day, imagine what happens if chronic insufficient sleep now
      becomes a daily habit. It can degenerate into a long term mood disorder.
      This will be characterized with constant depression, anxiety, anger,
      unhappiness and mental exhaustion.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine how many students are presently in
      your class going through this, and they do not know why! Their situation
      may drastically improve if they simply return to a normal sleep schedule;
      it becomes less fragile and more accommodating.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">RELAXATION</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Sleep reduces stress by causing your system
      to relax. Most part of your body is always in constant motion during your
      waking hours. Sleep time is the only opportunity you have to give your
      body and heart a rest by reducing your heart rate and blood pressure.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A good night's sleep can help you lower your
      blood pressure and also reduce the elevated levels of stress hormones,
      which are a natural result of this generation’s challenging and highly
      demanding lifestyles.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Even if you feel very tired and exhausted
      during the day and you discover the source of exhaustion is as a result of
      the amount of work done that day, taking a short nap is always the only
      natural way of reinvigorating yourself. You are able to function better
      once you wake up.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">HOW TO HELP YOURSELF SLEEP BETTER</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the way our higher institutions are
      structured, there are numerous factors that may make it difficult for you
      to maintain a regular sleep schedule. This may include living in the halls
      of residence with other students, studying for an emergency test or exams,
      taking late lectures, and socializing.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">These, in addition to some of your daily
      habits and activities may affect the quality and quantity of sleep you get
      per day. Discussed below are some suggestions that may help you modify
      your daily routine to promote better sleep at night.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">SIGN OUT FOR THE DAY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Conclude all needed transactions for the day
      before going to bed. Endeavor to be up to date with your classwork. Ensure
      your notes are copied, practical done, and every assignment meant to be
      submitted the next day are already taken care of. Thoughts of unfinished
      academic tasks can cause worrying while in bed, and this can keep you from
      falling asleep early enough.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">PLAN THE NEXT</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Plan your next day before you jump on your
      bed, at least mentally, if not written down on your ‘to do list’. Mentally
      planning the things you really need to get accomplished the next day
      before going to bed today will help you address the concerns for tomorrow
      that may keep you awake rolling on the bed for hours before you sleep.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">LATE NIGHT EXERCISE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As much as possible, avoid strenuous
      exercises or any other vigorous activities few hours before going to bed.
      This will help to avoid wakening up the body system even more, which makes
      it more difficult to fall asleep on time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">LIGHT DINNER</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Avoiding very weighty meals close to bedtime
      can also help you get a good night sleep. Eat smaller volume of meals. If
      you are a very heavy consumer, you may decide to take your dinner quite
      early so that the digestion process of the food would be completed before
      bedtime. Late heavy dinners sometimes leave undigested food in the
      stomach. The discomforts caused by this may interrupt your sleep
      intermittently, causing you to toss and turn for some part of the night.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">LATE NIGHT STUDY SESSIONS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As much as possible, avoid late night study
      sessions or all night study sessions (called in some places TDB; Till Day
      Break). Both may seem to give you the time you need to cover more grounds
      academically and the quiet environment needed to cram difficult courses,
      but it always drain your brain power by hindering your ability to perform
      well the next day.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">AVOID ALCOHOLS &amp; COFFEE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Avoid alcohols. It disrupts your sleep
      throughout the night. Some students take caffeinated coffee to stay awake
      for a while at night, so as to do some study. However, the coffee taken,
      since not measured by any duration of time, will keep you awake longer
      after you are done studying. You will discover that after completing your
      study, you will find it difficult to sleep. More so, making this a regular
      habit is injurious.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">COMFORTABLE BEDDINGS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Ensure your sleeping area is comfortable
      enough to encourage you to easily fall asleep and stay asleep. If you are
      given the option, select beddings, pillows, and mattress that will best
      suit your sleeping pattern. The texture, size and shape of pillows can
      make a lot difference. Choose pillows that will not cause undue strain on
      the neck.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Make use of the bed majorly for sleeping
      purposes. Avoid any other activities other than sleep whenever you are on
      the bed. Unless you are told, you may never realize how some of your
      innocent habits may be making it more difficult for you to fall asleep or
      stay asleep. This is one of them. Activities such as watching the tv,
      studying and playing computer games on your cellphones should be reduced
      whenever you are on the bed, that is if there are no other available
      options for these activities. This is because your body begins to
      associate the bed with these activities, and it becomes increasingly
      difficult to easily fall asleep once you lie on the bed.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">CONDUSIVE ROOM</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Keep your bedroom at a very comfortable
      temperature. The room should neither be too hot or too cold. Also try to
      get it well ventilated. The more comfortable you are in the room, the
      better your sleep on the bed.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">REGULAR SLEEP SCHEDULE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Endeavor to have a regular sleep time and
      wake up time every day. If you cannot fix a particular time, make it as
      close as possible to the same time every day. Sleeping at about the same
      time and waking up at about the same time will help your body get used to
      a sleeping schedule. Keep to this sleep routine as much as possible, but
      understand that there may be exceptions once in a while, depending on your
      work schedule.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">NIGHT SHOWER</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Take a quick shower every night just before
      bedtime. Although, as a full time student, it may be difficult to keep to
      this every night, but do it as often as you think it is needed.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Also, just before you jump on the bed,
      always remember to empty your bladder and bowels. Going to bed with a full
      bladder or bowel may interfere with your sleep unnecessarily.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">SWITCH OFF GADGETS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Electronic gadgets have overtaken many
      students’ bedrooms, keeping them awake longer than they should be, even
      while on their beds and are ready to sleep. In order to get quality sleep,
      it is advisable to switch off these gadgets, if possible, 10 to 20 minutes
      before sleep time. This will help you concentrate more on the task at
      hand, which is sleep, thereby getting the best from it. Jumping out of bed
      to attend to every sound of alert that comes from your cell phone can be
      very distracting. Students who enjoy doing this will only experience ‘junk
      sleep’, a type of sleep that is similar in effect to ‘junk foods’; it does
      not offer the students the best they should get, but only give them a
      deceptive satisfactory impression that they are doing what they need to
      do.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">GO SPIRITUAL</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Read some portion of a spiritual book or
      article each night before you sleep. This is better off than watching the
      nightly news or a movie. News and movies may get you more agitated.
      Spiritual materials will make a lot of difference in your sleep quality.
      It is relaxing, uplifting, and can help one to have a sense of peace and
      tranquility.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">LAST DOSE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If after staying on the bed for a while, you
      still do not feel sleepy, try listening to a recorded boring lecture or
      other boring CD or tape. This can be surprisingly good and effective; it
      sends you to sleep faster than listening to music or watching a movies.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">COPING WITH TROUBLESOME ROOM MATES</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Sharing a room on campus with roommates can
      make it very challenging to regulate your sleep environment. If you have
      not discussed what you have read in this chapter with him, it is possible
      that your roommate, unaware of the havoc he is causing himself, always
      decides to stay up all night in order to study, thereby leaving the light
      on. He may even decide to entertain some of his friends until very late.
      This happens from time to time in a campus environment. Rather than start
      fomenting troubles, you may look for creative ways to reduce these
      disruptions that may want to deny you a qualitative sleep.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(1) You may decide to sit him down, discuss
      with him, and both of you arrive at a regular and comfortable sleep time
      for both parties. Both parties must respect each other’s privacy and need
      for a quiet environment at the approved time, and no one should bring in
      guests at the time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(2) You may decide to get a desk lamp for
      your room. This will be available for the use of any room member who
      decides to read late at night. A desk lamp is preferable to the general
      overhead lights as only the one who needs the illumination gets it without
      disturbing the comfort of the others. Your roommates may not want to
      contribute funds for getting this. It is one of the sacrifices you will
      need to make to ensure that you get a good sleep.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(3) You may also get yourself a good sleep
      mask which you can use to block out any unwanted light from your immediate
      environment whenever you are ready to sleep. However, if the room is dark
      enough, eye coverings or sleep masks may not be needed.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(4) Rather than share beds with your
      roommates, use your own separate bed. This will ensure that a
      bed-partner’s visits to the restroom in the middle of the night, or his
      haphazard tossing and turning does not wake you up.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(5) Lastly, you may get your roommate a copy
      of this book, and let him also read what you have read. It may help him a
      great deal.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">WORD OF CAUTION</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Students need to begin to treat sleep as a
      priority, and not a luxury. This will help prevent a number of failures in
      so many examinations. However, this chapter on sleep is not meant to be
      used as an excuse to start sleeping idly all over the place. Do what you
      need to do during the day, so that your sleep will be justified during the
      night.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You will need to be mature enough so as not
      to begin to overdo it. Remember, there is no parent around to warn you of
      excesses if you decide to take things for granted. Be moderate about it.
      Even science has discovered that oversleeping can also lead to some of the
      same problems that result from sleep deprivation. Sleeping too much can
      increase the risk of heart problems, obesity and intellectual damage. So
      beware!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">CONCLUSION</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you have indeed followed all the other
      five habits of highly effective students, as discussed in the last five
      chapters, you really will not want to deny yourself the benefits in these
      three factors discussed in this chapter which can unconsciously contribute
      greatly to your desire to graduate from school with a good G.P.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">These three put together; poor nutrition,
      inability to engage in physical exercise and poor sleep habit can lead to
      a devastating effect in the life of any student. It is the combination of
      these factors; regular physical exercise, good nutrition, and adequate
      sleep that generally encourage a good mental performance.</p>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">INVOLVE THE SUPERNATURAL</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The last habit of highly effective students
      is that they always involve the supernatural in their academics. They do
      not go the distance alone; they make it a cooperative effort between God
      and them. This may be the last but it is in no way the least.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There is so much that can be
      achieved in the power of his strength. But there is a power that comes
      from above, which makes a man achieves much more than his human ability
      can make him to. This superhuman power comes from God.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most students claim to know this, but really
      do not operate its principles. It is not about being religious: it is
      about creating a pact between you and the God of heavens who rules in the
      affairs of men. The horse may be prepared well for the day of the battle,
      but victory belongs to the one whom the Lord is pleased with.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">When you involve the supernatural in your
      academics by committing it to God in prayers from time to time, you enjoy
      a rare grace which other students who do not do this are denied. This
      grace can come in various ways:</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It may come in the form of a photographic
      memory which helps you to understand everything you are taught in class
      faster and better. It makes your personal study time very interesting as
      you are quick to grab every word you read. You will also find it easy to
      remember the things read when you are asked in the examination hall. These
      are some of the benefits you enjoy by keeping a relationship with God.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">When preparing for examinations, this grace
      may guide you to the chapters and pages you specifically need to study for
      each course, thereby saving you from minoring on the major and majoring on
      the minor. It also ensures that you have a stable health so that you do
      not fall sick either before or during the examinations</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">No matter the level of preparation, how well
      you pass depends on how your answer script is marked. The last you will
      see of this script is in the examination hall. Once the script is handed
      over to the invigilator, you only wait to see the examiner’s opinion of
      what you have written. At such time, the supernatural God can give you
      favor in the sight of whoever marks your script, such that he marks the
      script with leniency, and is willing to be extravagant with marks in order
      to make you pass well, even without knowing you from Adam.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Things happen that are beyond the natural.
      Imagine a scenario where your examiner takes your script to mark, and just
      before marking, he receives a call telling him that he has been</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">promoted in the academic cadre. After
      sharing the news with his family, he decides to continue marking your
      script. He will definitely mark your script with so much joy and gladness.
      But imagine if it is the other way round, and the caller only informs him
      that he has been denied the promotion which he had been expecting for the
      past 4years, and he still decides to mark your script after the call. You
      can be sure that, no matter the lecturer’s level of professionalism, his
      immediate situation will reflect in the way the script is marked. You need
      not be told that the particular student in the first scenario will enjoy
      more compassion from the lecturer than the second.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is why the effective students do not
      joke with the supernatural. They always involve God, in whose hands lies
      the heart of every lecturer, invigilator and examiner, and he can twist it
      to wherever he likes.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is not strange in this part of the world
      to have answer script missing in transit. After all of the efforts
      invested in attending lectures, concentrating in class, doing personal
      study, managing your time effectively, networking with other brains, and
      then ensuring you have written all you need to write in the examination
      hall, only to be faced with the news that your script got missing!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This can be very devastating. However, if
      you involve the supernatural in your academics, your examination answer
      scripts will be monitored each step of the way by his angels. He will take
      special interest in you and all that is yours.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A whole volume can be written on all you
      stand to gain by involving the supernatural, but for want of space, it
      will be summarized in one word: without God, man is nothing; with God,
      even one is a majority.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you have not done that before now,
      determine to join forces with God, and you will discover that the sky is
      your starting point.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is the seventh habit of effective
      students, and the most important of them all...</p>
